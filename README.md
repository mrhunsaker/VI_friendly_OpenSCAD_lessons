# 3D Design & Printing Curriculum — Enhanced Edition

**Author:** Chris Correll (original) / Expanded curriculum  
**Last Updated:** 2026  
**Target Audience:** High school students, including students with visual impairments (BVI)

## Overview

This curriculum teaches 3D design and fabrication using OpenSCAD and FDM 3D printing. Students progress from foundational skills through guided projects and into open-ended, stakeholder-driven design challenges. The curriculum is built around the principle of **explicit instruction before application** — each new skill is taught in a dedicated lesson before students are expected to apply it in a project.

### Design Philosophy

Students move through four roles across the curriculum:

| Phase | Role | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| Unit 0 | **Observer/Learner** | Concepts, tools, safety |
| Unit 1 | **Operator** | Guided replication, measurement |
| Unit 2 | **Designer** | Parametric thinking, materials |
| Unit 3 | **Problem-Solver** | Real users, iteration, impact |

## How This Curriculum Was Expanded

The original curriculum (Projects 0–Bonus) provided excellent real-world projects but assumed students could acquire skills through project work alone. This expanded curriculum adds:

1. **Six foundational lessons** (Unit 0) that explicitly teach every skill before it is needed
2. **Four intermediate lessons** (Unit 2) that bridge guided and open-ended projects
3. **One stakeholder interview lesson** (Unit 3) that prepares students for Project 2
4. **One new project** (Project 4: Assistive Technology)
5. **Six reference documents** that serve as ongoing resources throughout the year
