# Parametric Keychain - Teacher Template (Extension Project) {#3dmake_foundation_lessons_3dmake_6-parametric_keychain_teacher_template}

## Briefing

Students design}} a personalized keychain using}} fully parametric}} OpenSCAD}} code}}. This project emphasizes parameter}}-driven design}}, customization, and user-centered iteration.

Key Learning: Parametric modularity; customization; design}} for manufacturing variation.

Real-world Connection: Mass customization is a growing manufacturing trend. Parametric design}} enables efficient production of personalized products.

## Constraints
- Keychain must be fully parametric}} (text}}, size, material}} all variables}})
- Design}} must include at least one}} test}} for different parameter}} values
- Assembly instructions must support}} varied configurations
- Code must be documented for future customization

## Functional Requirements
- All design}} elements are parametric}} variables}}
- Keychain includes personalization (names, initials, dates)
- Multiple variant configurations tested and documented
- Design}} is reproducible and shareable

## Deliverables
- `.scad` with parametric}} keychain module}}
- Variant specification table (3+ configurations)
- Photos of at least 2 printed variants
- Customization guide for future users
- Code documentation and usage examples

## Rubric

### Category 1: Problem & Solution (0-3)
Keychains print}} successfully and are functional/customizable.

### Category 2: Design}} & Code Quality (0-3)
Code is fully parametric}} and well-organized. Variants work}} well.

### Category 3: Documentation (0-3)
Variant table complete. Customization guide clear and detailed.

## Assessment Notes

- Strong submissions: Show comprehensive parametric}} thinking, multiple tested variants, and clear guidance for customization
- Reinforce: Documentation for design}} reuse
- Extension: User feedback on customization preferences; commercial potential analysis
