# Dice, Dice, Dice - Teacher Template (Extension Project) {#3dmake_foundation_lessons_3dmake_4-dice_dice_dice_teacher_template}

## Briefing

Students design}} and test}} fair 3D-printed dice to explore geometry}}, symmetry, manufacturing precision, and statistical validation. This project combines physics, materials science, and rigorous testing practices.

Key Learning: Precision manufacturing; fairness validation; quality}} assurance.

Real-world Connection: Manufacturing quality}} assurance requires measurement, testing, and statistical analysis. Casino dice are one}} of the most rigorously tested manufactured objects.

## Constraints
- Dice must be generated parametrically in OpenSCAD}}
- Student must conduct fairness testing (100+ rolls minimum)
- Design}} must address weight distribution and uniform geometry}}
- Statistical analysis of test}} results required

## Functional Requirements
- Dice geometry}} is parametric}} (size, infill, details)
- All faces print}} with usable pips/markers
- Statistical testing conducted with documented results
- Analysis shows understanding of fairness criteria

## Deliverables
- `.scad` file}} with parametric}} dice module}}
- Completed documentation template with fairness test}} results
- Statistical analysis (roll frequency data, calculations)
- Photos of test}} dice and assembly
- Reflection on design}} precision and manufacturing tolerances

## Rubric

### Category 1: Problem & Solution (0-3)
Dice print}} successfully and fairness testing conducted rigorously.

### Category 2: Design}} & Code Quality (0-3)
Code is parametric}} and thoughtful. Dice design}} shows understanding of symmetry and balance.

### Category 3: Documentation (0-3)
Testing data complete and organized. Statistical analysis accurate and insightful.

## Assessment Notes

- Strong submissions: Show rigorous fairness testing (100+ rolls), clear statistical analysis, and reflection on manufacturing precision
- Reinforce: Why uniformity matters; how to test}} for bias
- Extension: Material comparisons; cost-benefit analysis of infill vs. fairness
