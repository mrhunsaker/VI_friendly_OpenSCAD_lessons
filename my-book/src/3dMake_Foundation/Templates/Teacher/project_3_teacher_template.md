# Project 3: Beaded Jewelry — Teacher Template

## Briefing

Students design and produce a complete wearable jewelry piece using parametric OpenSCAD modules. This capstone project integrates all previous skills—parametric design, iteration, assembly—while introducing modular thinking and design documentation for reproducibility.

**Key Learning:** Modular design; parametric thinking at scale; documentation for manufacturing.

**Real-world Connection:** Modular design is used in architecture, engineering, and manufacturing. Parametric modules allow designs to scale and adapt to different contexts.

## Constraints
- Jewelry must include at least 8 3D-printed beads (or similar repeated elements)
- Must use at least two distinct parametric bead modules
- All dimensions must be variables for repeatability
- Final piece must be assembled and wearable (necklace, bracelet, anklet, etc.)
- Complete `.scad` source must be provided

## Functional Requirements
- Bead modules are parametric (size, detail level adjustable)
- At least 8 beads print successfully and are usable
- Beads assemble into a cohesive, wearable piece
- Design shows evidence of iteration (hole diameters, spacing, or material tested)
- Code is well-commented and modular

## Deliverables
- `project3.scad` with at least two parametric bead modules and assembly script
- Completed documentation template with:
  - Design sketches or descriptions of both bead modules
  - Photos of test beads and final assembled piece
  - Print log (temperatures, times, material used)
  - Iteration notes (what changed and why)
  - Reflection on design process and challenges
- Assembled wearable piece (if physically feasible; otherwise high-quality photo)
- Optional: Variant designs or parameter comparison table

## Rubric

All projects are scored on a 0–9 scale across three equally weighted categories (3 points each):

| Category | Points | What We Measure |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| **Problem & Solution** | 0–3 | Is the assembled piece wearable and complete? Do all beads meet functional specs? |
| **Design & Code Quality** | 0–3 | Is the code modular, parametric, and well-documented? Is iteration evident? Are beads aesthetically and functionally sound? |
| **Documentation** | 0–3 | Are all sections complete? Is iteration documented with photos? Are reflections specific and show learning? |

### Category 1: Problem & Solution (0–3 points)

| Score | Description |
| ------- | ------------- |
| **3** | Assembled piece is fully wearable with all beads present. At least 8 beads per specification. Assembly is secure and functional. |
| **2** | Piece is largely wearable with minor issues (loose string, slight assembly gaps). All beads present and mostly functional. |
| **1** | Piece is partially wearable or incomplete. Some beads missing or non-functional. |
| **0** | Piece is not assembled or wearable. |

### Category 2: Design & Code Quality (0–3 points)

| Score | Description |
| ------- | ------------- |
| **3** | Code is modular with two or more distinct, parametric bead modules. Well-commented. Beads are aesthetically appealing. At least one iteration cycle evident (e.g., hole diameter adjusted). |
| **2** | Code is modular but could be clearer. Some parametric structure evident. Beads print well. Some iteration. |
| **1** | Code is minimal or poorly organized. Limited parametric structure. Beads print but lack refinement. |
| **0** | Code does not work or is not submitted. |

### Category 3: Documentation (0–3 points)

| Score | Description |
| ------- | ------------- |
| **3** | All sections complete with design descriptions, module parameters, print logs, and iteration notes. Photos of prototypes and final piece. Reflection is specific and shows learning. |
| **2** | Most sections present. Print log and iteration notes included. Photos included. Reflection shows some thought. |
| **1** | Documentation incomplete. Missing print log or iteration notes. Few or no photos. |
| **0** | No documentation submitted. |

### Score Interpretation

| Total Score | Interpretation | Next Step |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----------- |
| 8–9 | Excellent capstone | Student is ready for advanced projects or professional applications |
| 6–7 | Strong design and execution | Encourage portfolio development or design extensions |
| 4–5 | Meets basics; needs refinement | Resubmit documentation or design iteration |
| 2–3 | Does not meet expectations | Resubmission required |
| 0–1 | Missing major work | Meet with instructor |

## Resubmission Policy

Students may resubmit to improve their score. Resubmissions must include:
1. A one-paragraph explanation of what was changed and why

The resubmission score **replaces** the original.

## Assessment Notes

- **Strong submissions** show clear modular thinking, parametric structure, iteration with measured changes, and thoughtful reflection on design trade-offs
- **Watch for:** Hard-coded dimensions, minimal comments, or poor assembly documentation
- **Reinforce:** Why parametric modules matter for design scalability and reuse
- **Extension:** Portfolio-ready designs; consider publication on Thingiverse or Printables
