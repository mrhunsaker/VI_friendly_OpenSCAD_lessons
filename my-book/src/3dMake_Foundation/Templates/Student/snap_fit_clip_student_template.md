# Snap-Fit Clip — Student Documentation Template (Extension Project)

- Author:
- Date:
- Description: Design a snap-fit connector that joins two 3D-printed parts without external fasteners.

---

## Design Concept

- What two parts will your snap-fit connect?
- Design approach (cantilever, torsion box, other):
- Material and expected stress limits:

---

## Tolerance Specifications

| Parameter | Nominal Value | Tolerance | Rationale |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Tab thickness |  |  |  |
| Clip opening |  |  |  |
| Undercut depth |  |  |  |
| Contact area |  |  |  |

## Assembly Testing

### Test 1: Initial Assembly
- Date:
- Effort required to snap together:
- Snap strength (resistance to pulling apart):
- Visual inspection (any deformation?):

### Test 2–5: Reusability Testing
- Cycle 2: (date, observations)
- Cycle 3: (date, observations)
- Cycle 4: (date, observations)
- Cycle 5: (date, observations)

### Durability Assessment
- After 5 cycles, is the snap-fit still functional?
- Any permanent deformation observed?
- Estimated service life (based on testing):

---

## Mechanical Analysis

- Describe the snap mechanism (why does it work?):
- What material properties enable this design?
- What are the stress points?

---

## Reflections

- Did the snap-fit work as expected?
- What tolerance adjustments would you make?
- How would you test durability over thousands of cycles?
- What materials would fail with this design? Why?
