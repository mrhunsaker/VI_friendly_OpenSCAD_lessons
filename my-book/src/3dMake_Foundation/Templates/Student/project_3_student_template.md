## Ideas and Concept

### Jewelry Design Vision
- What type of jewelry are you creating (necklace, bracelet, anklet, etc.)?
- What aesthetic or functional theme guides your design?
- Who is the intended wearer?

### Bead Module Concepts

#### Module A: `bead_A(size, detail)`
- Shape description:
- Parameters and their purposes:
- Why this design?

#### Module B: `bead_B(size, detail)`
- Shape description:
- Parameters and their purposes:
- Why this design?

### Design Sketches or Descriptions
(Include rough sketches or detailed descriptions of how beads will be arranged)

| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | --------- | ------- |
| A           |              |              |              |           |         |
| B           |              |              |              |           |         |
| Assembly    |              |              |              |           |         |

### Assembly and Use Notes

- How are beads strung or assembled?
- What challenges did you encounter during assembly?
- How is the clasp or closure secured?
- Estimated wear lifespan (based on material and stress):

## Reflections

### Design Evolution
- Describe the most significant change between your initial concept and final design
- Why did you make this change?

### Iteration Results

| Iteration | What Changed | Result | Next Action |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------- | ------------- |
| Design v1   |               |         |               |
| Design v2   |               |         |               |

### Challenges and Solutions
- What was the hardest part of this project?
- How did you solve it?

### Learning Reflections
- What did you learn about parametric design from this project?
- How would you scale this design (e.g., make larger/smaller versions)?
- What would you do differently if you redesigned this piece?

### Accessibility Notes
- How did you approach testing and documentation for screen reader users?
- What parts of the workflow were accessible? What was challenging?
