4. Step 3 — Connect _____:
5. Final assembly:

### Tolerance Management at Interfaces

| Interface | Nominal Gaps | Tolerance | Rationale |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | --------- |
|             |               |             |           |
|             |               |             |           |

## Assembly Results

- All parts assembled successfully: Yes / No
- Assembly time: _____ minutes
- Any challenges during assembly?
- Quality of final assembly:

---

## Reflections

- Did the assembly sequence work as planned?
- What tolerance issues did you encounter?
- How would you document this for someone else to build?
- What would you change for a second version?
