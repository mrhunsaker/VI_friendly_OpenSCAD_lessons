# Part 2: 3dMake Foundation - Using OpenSCAD for Accessible 3D Design {#3dmake_foundation-part_2}

This section covers the complete 3D design and printing workflow using OpenSCAD, 3DMake, and accessible tools. Students progress from basic primitives through advanced parametric design and stakeholder-centric projects.

**Time commitment:** 30-40 hours instruction + projects  
**Skills gained:** 3D modeling, parametric design, automated workflows, tolerance testing, quality assurance
