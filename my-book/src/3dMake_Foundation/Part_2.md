# 3dMake-Accessible Design with OpenSCAD

This section covers the complete 3D design and printing workflow using OpenSCAD, 3DMake, and accessible tools. Students progress from basic primitives through advanced parametric design and stakeholder-centric projects.

Time commitment: 30-40 hours instruction + projects  

Skills gained: 3D modeling, parametric design, automated workflows, tolerance testing, quality assurance
