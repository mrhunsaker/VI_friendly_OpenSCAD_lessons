## Terms

**Additive manufacturing** — A family of processes that build objects by adding material layer by layer. 3D printing is a form of additive manufacturing.

**ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)** — A common plastic filament, stronger and more heat-resistant than PLA, but harder to print and emits more fumes.

**Bed adhesion** — How well the first layer sticks to the print bed. Poor adhesion causes warping. Improved by using a heated bed, glue stick, or painter's tape.

**Boolean operation** — An operation that combines or subtracts 3D shapes. The three types in OpenSCAD are `union()`, `difference()`, and `intersection()`.

**Brim** — A flat ring printed around the base of a model to help it stick to the build plate. Removed after printing.

**Build plate / print bed** — The flat surface on which the 3D object is built. May be heated.

**CAD (Computer-Aided Design)** — Using software to create 2D or 3D models. OpenSCAD is a form of CAD.

**Caliper** — A precision measuring tool used to measure the length, width, height, diameter, or depth of objects to the nearest 0.1 mm or finer.

**Clearance** — An intentional gap added to a design so that two parts fit together with the desired level of looseness or tightness.

**Constructive solid geometry (CSG)** — A modeling approach where complex shapes are built from simple primitives using Boolean operations (adding, subtracting, intersecting).

**Cooling fan** — A fan on the printer that cools the extruded plastic as it is deposited, helping layers set quickly and maintain shape.

**difference()** — OpenSCAD command that subtracts one shape from another, creating holes or recesses.

**Direct drive extruder** — An extruder mounted directly above the hot end. Better for flexible filaments (TPU) because the filament path is short.

**Extruder** — The mechanism that grips and feeds filament into the hot end.

**FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)** — The most common type of 3D printing. Melts plastic filament and deposits it layer by layer.

**Filament** — The plastic material used as "ink" in FDM printing. Comes on spools in 1.75 mm diameter rolls.

**Functional requirement** — A testable statement describing what a design must do. Example: "The marker must support the weight of a desk rolling over it."

**G-code** — The machine instruction language that tells the 3D printer exactly where to move and at what temperature. Generated by the slicer.

**Hot end / nozzle** — The heated component that melts and extrudes the filament. Typically heated to 200–250°C depending on material.

**Infill** — The internal structure of a printed object. Usually expressed as a percentage (e.g., 15% infill = 15% solid inside). Common patterns include grid, gyroid, and honeycomb.

**intersection()** — OpenSCAD command that keeps only the region where two shapes overlap.

**Layer height** — The thickness of each printed layer. Typical values: 0.1 mm (fine detail) to 0.3 mm (fast/draft). Affects surface quality and print time.

**Linear extrusion** — In OpenSCAD, `linear_extrude()` turns a 2D shape into a 3D object by extending it upward.

**Module** — In OpenSCAD, a reusable block of code that can be called with different parameters to create variations.

**Overhang** — A portion of a model that extends beyond the layer below it. Overhangs above ~45° require support structures.

**Parameter / parametric design** — A design approach where dimensions are stored as variables, so changing one number updates the whole model.

**PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol-modified)** — A durable, moderately flexible filament. More impact-resistant and heat-resistant than PLA; easier to print than ABS.

**PLA (Polylactic Acid)** — The most common beginner filament. Bio-derived, easy to print, low-emission. Brittle under impact and heat-sensitive.

**Primitive** — A basic 3D shape in OpenSCAD: cube, sphere, cylinder. Complex objects are built by combining primitives.

**Render** — In OpenSCAD, pressing F6 generates a full, final 3D model from your code. Slower than Preview (F5) but required for export.

**Retraction** — A slicer setting that briefly pulls the filament backward when the nozzle moves without printing, to prevent strings of plastic between features.

**rotate()** — OpenSCAD command that rotates a shape around the X, Y, or Z axis.

**Slicer** — Software (e.g., PrusaSlicer) that converts a 3D model (.stl) into G-code instructions for a specific printer.

**Stakeholder** — A person who has a meaningful interest in whether a design succeeds — typically the person you are designing for.

**STL file (.stl)** — The standard file format for 3D models used in most slicers. Describes the geometry of a shape as a mesh of triangles.

**Support structures** — Temporary scaffolding material generated by the slicer to support overhangs during printing. Removed after the print is complete.

**Tolerance** — The acceptable amount of dimensional variation in a printed part. FDM printers typically have a tolerance of ±0.15–0.30 mm.

**TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane)** — A flexible filament used for rubber-like parts: phone cases, wearables, shock absorbers. Harder to print than PLA.

**translate()** — OpenSCAD command that moves a shape along the X, Y, and/or Z axis.

**union()** — OpenSCAD command that combines two or more shapes into a single solid.

**Warp / warping** — A print defect where the corners or edges of a print lift off the build plate due to uneven cooling.

**$fn** — OpenSCAD special variable that sets the number of faces on rounded shapes (spheres, cylinders). Higher = smoother. Typical values: 20–100.
