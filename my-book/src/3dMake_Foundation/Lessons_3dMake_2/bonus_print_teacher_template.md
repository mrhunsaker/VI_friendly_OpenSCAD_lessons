# Bonus Print - Teacher Template (Extension Project) {#3dmake_foundation_lessons_3dmake_2-bonus_print_teacher_template}

## Briefing

Students design scaled variants of a 3D-printable object to explore parametric design and manufacturing trade-offs. This project emphasizes variant generation, documentation, and the relationship between design parameters and print outcomes.

Key Learning: Parametric scaling; variant generation; trade-off analysis.

Real-world Connection: Manufacturing efficiency depends on understanding how parameter changes affect production time, material use, and functionality.

## Constraints
- Must generate at least 3 scaled variants of a single base design
- All variants must be parametric (variables clearly documented)
- Student must document print parameters for each variant
- Variants must be compared on measurable criteria (time, material, fit, etc.)

## Functional Requirements
- Variants are generated parametrically, not manually resized in slicer
- Each variant prints successfully
- Comparison metrics recorded for all variants
- Code is well-commented and organized

## Deliverables
- Parametric `.scad` with variant generation code
- Completed documentation template with variant specifications
- Print log for all variants
- Comparison matrix (time, material, quality, cost)
- Photos of all variants
- Reflection on design scalability

## Rubric
(Same three-category 0-9 scale as other projects)

### Category 1: Problem & Solution (0-3)
All variants print successfully and meet comparison criteria.

### Category 2: Design & Code Quality (0-3)
Code is parametric and well-commented. Variants show thoughtful design thinking.

### Category 3: Documentation (0-3)
Comparison matrix complete. Reflection specific and insightful.

## Assessment Notes

- Strong submissions: Show parametric structure, complete comparison matrix, and insightful reflection on scaling trade-offs
- Reinforce: How parametric thinking enables rapid variant generation
- Extension: Cost-benefit analysis; material property comparisons
