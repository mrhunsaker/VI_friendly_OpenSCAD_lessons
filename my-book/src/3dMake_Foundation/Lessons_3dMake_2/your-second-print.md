# Real-Life Problem Solver - Guided Extension  {#3dmake_foundation_lessons_3dmake_2-your-second-print}}}

Estimated time}}: 4-8 hours (design}}, adapt, print}}, and document)

## Learning Objectives
- Identify a user problem and evaluate candidate printed solutions
- Adapt an existing model to meet real constraints and safety requirements
- Test, measure, and iterate on a prototype with documented decisions

## Materials
- Computer with slicer and access to repositories
- Printer, filament}}, basic hand tools for post-processing

## Step-by-step Tasks
1. Interview a potential user (or yourself) and write}} a 1-paragraph problem statement.
2. Search repositories for candidate models; list three options and justify which one}} you}} will adapt.
3. Adapt the model (scale, add mounts, or modify features) and document the changes in a short changelog.
4. Slice, print}}, and run}} a supervised test}} of the prototype; log any failures and corrective actions.
5. Produce a final report summarizing performance, measured deviations, and next steps.

## Probing Questions
- What assumptions did you}} make about the user's context? How could you}} validate them?
- Which adaptation had the biggest impact on function and why?

## Quiz - Your Second Print (10 questions)
1. What is a good first}} question to ask a stakeholder when scoping this project? (short answer)
2. Name one}} safety consideration when adapting a model for daily use. (short answer)
3. What is a changelog entry? (one}} sentence)
4. How do you}} verify a fit for an assembled part}}? (short answer)
5. Why document corrective actions during testing? (one}} sentence)
6. True/False: Once you}} complete a successful first}} print}}, any second project will automatically succeed without iteration. (Answer: False)
7. Short answer: Describe one}} method to gather user feedback on your adapted model before}} committing to a full production print}}.
8. Practical scenario: Your adapted model prints but feels too fragile in daily use. What are two strategies to improve durability while maintaining the basic form?
9. Multiple choice: When you}} create}} a changelog, what should you}} document? (A) Only the successful changes (B) All changes, including failures and iterations (C) Only the slicer settings - Answer: B
10. Reflection: Explain how iteration (design}} -> print}} -> test}} -> adapt) leads to better functional outcomes than trying to get the design}} perfect on the first}} attempt. Give a specific}} example from your project.

## Extension Problems (10)
1. Rework your prototype to improve durability and report trade-offs in weight and print}} time}}.
2. Create a user test}} script}} and run}} it with two participants; summarize results.
3. Convert a critical component to parametric}} OpenSCAD}} and publish the variant.
4. Add a small assembly guide with tactile cues for non-visual users.
5. Compare two filament}} types for the same part}} and recommend one}} with justification.
6. Execute a formal design}} iteration cycle: print}}, test}}, measure, analyze, revise; repeat at least 3 times and document improvements.
7. Build a comparative analysis: print}} your part}} in 2 different materials or with 2 different profiles; measure and compare all key properties.
8. Create a complete design}} dossier: CAD files}}, iteration history, test}} results, measurements, lessons learned, and final recommendations.
9. Develop a user testing protocol: define success metrics, recruit testers, gather systematic feedback, and iterate based on results.
10. Write a design}} case study: document your entire project journey from initial concept through final manufacture, including all mistakes and successes.
