- Description: Create scaled variants of a design}} to explore parametric}} thinking and manufacturing trade-offs.

## Design}} Concept

- Base design}} name}} and description:
- Why did you}} choose this design}}?
- How will you}} generate variants parametrically?

## Variant Specifications

| Variant | Scale | Print Time (est.) | Filament (est.) | Key Dimensions |
|---------|-------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| v1      |       |                   |                 |                |
| v2      |       |                   |                 |                |
| v3      |       |                   |                 |                |

## Print Results

| Variant | Actual Print Time | Actual Filament | Quality | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|---------|-------|
| v1      |                   |                 |         |       |
| v2      |                   |                 |         |       |
| v3      |                   |                 |         |       |

## Analysis and Reflections

- Which variant is most efficient (time}}/material}} ratio)?
- How did scaling affect print}} quality}}?
- What trade-offs did you}} observe (speed vs. quality}}, material}} vs. time}})?
- If you}} made a fourth variant, what would it be and why?
