## Overview

## Introduction to the Online Course

This online course offers a purpose-built pathway for students who are blind or visually impaired to learn 3D design and FDM printing using OpenSCAD. It combines clear, text-driven CAD workflows with tactile practices and measurement-based exercises so that learners can develop spatial understanding without relying on visual previews.

The course favors explicit instruction before open-ended work: each technical skill is introduced, practiced, and assessed before it is required in a project. That scaffolding helps reduce cognitive load and gives students predictable steps to follow when they move into guided and then independent projects.

Because accessibility is central to the design, the curriculum emphasizes non-visual toolchains and workflows — for example, textual parametric modeling, command-line slicer integrations, and methods for producing tactile proofs and prototypes. Where visual tools help, the materials provide alternate descriptions and processes that work with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

OpenSCAD is chosen intentionally: its programmatic, textual interface plays well with assistive technology and encourages a precise, repeatable design approach. Students learn to express geometry as code, to parameterize designs for fit and function, and to produce artifacts that can be tested and iterated without visual inspection.

Projects are arranged as a progression: foundational lessons teach core concepts and safety, guided projects let students practice skills with structured feedback, and open-ended projects — including a stakeholder-driven assistive-technology capstone — require students to apply design thinking, documentation, and user testing.

Iteration is baked into the process. Every major project asks for at least two prototyping cycles, stakeholder interviews, and documented revisions, so learners gain experience with real-world design feedback and the discipline of improving a solution over time.

Assessment blends technical criteria and process skills: rubrics measure stakeholder engagement, the quality of iteration, and how well final prints meet the agreed functional requirements. Documentation and reflective practice are graded as part of the learning outcomes.

The course also connects students to community resources, open repositories, and continuing practice: e-NABLE, Makers Making Change, NIH 3D Print Exchange, Printables, and Thingiverse are included as research starting points. These sources provide examples, remixable designs, and inspiration for real-world assistive solutions.

Practical outcomes are central: beyond CAD and printing skills, students develop communication, collaboration, and project documentation abilities that translate to employment and community engagement. The online format and downloadable assets make the materials easy to host with mdBook and share with students and instructors.
