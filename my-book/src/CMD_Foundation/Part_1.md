# Part 1: Foundations of Windows CMD - Terminal & Screen Reader Accessibility

This section covers terminal fundamentals, screen reader accessibility, and command-line basics needed before diving into 3D design with OpenSCAD. This is an alternate pathway to the PowerShell curriculum, using Windows Command Prompt (CMD) instead.

**Time commitment:** ~10 hours  
**Skills gained:** Terminal navigation, file operations, basic scripting, keyboard-only workflow mastery  
**Note:** CMD is simpler than PowerShell but has fewer advanced features. Both pathways teach the same fundamental concepts.
