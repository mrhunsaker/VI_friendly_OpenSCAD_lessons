## Briefing
You will pick a model from an online 3D model repository and slice and print it.

## Constraints
- You must use one of the following 3D model repos:
  - [Printable](https://www.printables.com/)
  - [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/)

## Functional Requirements
- Your model must be a different size then the downloaded model
- You must print your model all in one print if it has multiple pieces
- You must print all pieces of your model if it has multiple pieces (no need to print different versions just all of the pieces for at least one version)

## Deliverables (via email and physically turn in 3D print)
- Technical documentation, shared on google drive, including the following sections:
  - Link to file
  - Design Modifications
  - Construction/ 3D Printing Notes
  - Photos of the final print

## Rubric
Projects are graded on a 0 to 9 point scale as determined by the class project rubric
