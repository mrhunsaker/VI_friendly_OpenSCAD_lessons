# Parametric Keychain — Extension Project (Self-Paced)

Estimated time: 2–4 hours

Objective:

Tasks:
1. Create `keychain.scad` with top-level parameters: `width`, `height`, `thickness`, and `text`.
2. Implement embossed or debossed text using `linear_extrude()` of a 2D text shape (or simulate with simple geometry if system lacks text support).
3. Produce three size variants and export STLs; record print settings.
4. Test attachment point for common key rings and report fit.

Deliverable:
