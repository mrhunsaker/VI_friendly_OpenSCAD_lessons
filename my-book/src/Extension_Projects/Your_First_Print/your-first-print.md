# Your First Print — Guided Extension (Self-Paced)

**Accessibility:** When including images or diagrams, add short alt-text and provide a comment-based walkthrough for any .scad examples so screen-reader users can follow the design steps.


Estimated time: 2–4 hours (including setup and print monitoring)

**Learning Objectives**
- Select a simple ready-made model and evaluate its printability for a classroom printer
- Configure slicer settings for a short-duration print and prepare the printer safely
- Document print parameters and reflect on the physical outcome

**Materials**
- Computer with slicer and access to the online repository
- Prusa Mini+ or classroom-approved printer, filament spool

Step-by-step Tasks
1. Choose a simple model (<2 hours print) from Thingiverse or Printables and save the STL.
2. Inspect the model: note overhangs, thin features, and dimensions; write two short reasons why this model is appropriate for a first print.
3. Load the model in your slicer, select the classroom profile, and adjust settings only if necessary (layer height, infill, supports). Record the final print time and filament estimate.
4. Perform safety checks, start the print, and monitor the first 10 minutes for adhesion and extrusion problems.
5. After cooling, measure three critical dimensions and compare to the model’s stated dimensions; record deviations.

Probing Questions
- Why did you select this model? What risks did you anticipate and how did you mitigate them?
- Which slicer setting most affects print time for this model and why?
- If a thin feature failed, what minimal change would you make to ensure success next time?

Quick Quiz (5)
1. What is the first-check you do after loading filament? (short answer)
2. Name two slicer settings that affect strength. (short answer)
3. Why monitor the first layers of a print? (one sentence)
4. How do you document filament used for reproducibility? (short answer)
5. What is one sign of poor bed adhesion? (one sentence)

Extension Problems (5)
1. Re-slice the model with a finer layer height and compare surface finish and print time; document differences.
2. Modify the model in OpenSCAD to thicken a failing feature and reprint a small test piece.
3. Create a short checklist script (or text checklist) that verifies spool metadata and bed temperature before printing.
4. Produce a one-page reflection that includes three lessons learned and one parameter you will change next time.
5. Share your measurements and photos in the class folder and give feedback on two peers’ prints.

**Deliverables**
- Short report: model chosen, key slicer settings, measured deviations, and answers to probing questions.
- Photos of the final print and the measured values table.
