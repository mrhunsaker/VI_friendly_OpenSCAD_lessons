# Miniature Assembly — Extension Project (Self-Paced)

Estimated time: 4–8 hours

Objective:
- Break a small object into printable sub-parts and design mating features for assembly.

Tasks:
1. Select a simple object and design it as 2–4 printable parts with alignment features.
2. Implement parametric tabs/slots or dowel-style pegs in OpenSCAD.
3. Print parts, assemble, and document required post-processing and tolerances.
4. Produce an assembly guide with tactile cues for non-visual users.

Deliverable:
- Source `.scad` files, STLs, assembly photos, and an assembly guide.
