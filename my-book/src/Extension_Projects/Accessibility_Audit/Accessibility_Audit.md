# Accessibility Audit — Extension Project (Self-Paced)

Estimated time: 2–4 hours

Objective:
- Evaluate one lesson or project for non-visual accessibility and produce a prioritized improvement plan.

Tasks:
1. Select one lesson or project (OpenSCAD file + markdown instructions) and review for accessibility shortcomings.
2. Create a short checklist (images alt-text, code walkthroughs, tactile cues, file naming) and apply it to the chosen resource.
3. Implement at least three small improvements (alt text, clearer code comments, or a text-only walkthrough) and document changes.
4. Produce a summary with suggested larger changes and an estimate of the instructor time to implement them.

Deliverable:
- A one-page audit report and a patch (diff) suggestion for the target lesson.

Starter files
- [starter.scad](../../assets/Extension_Projects/Accessibility_Audit/starter.scad) — small tactile marker scaffold for testing contrast and tactile cues.
