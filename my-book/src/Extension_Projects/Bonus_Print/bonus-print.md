Bonus Print — Guided Extension (Self-Paced)

Estimated time: 3–5 hours

**Learning Objectives**
- Apply scaling and simple modifications to an existing model
- Verify multi-part prints and manage print constraints
- Document design changes and reproduceable print settings

**Materials**
- Online repository access, slicer, printer, filament

Step-by-step Tasks
1. Choose a model from Thingiverse or Printables and note the original dimensions.
2. Decide on a purposeful modification (scale, add mounting holes, combine parts) and explain why.
3. Apply changes in OpenSCAD (or by scaling in the slicer) and record the new dimensions.
4. Slice and print all parts in one session when possible; log print times and filament used.
5. Create a short construction note and photograph the assembled result.

Probing Questions
- What motivated the modification and who benefits from it?
- How did scaling affect tolerances or assembly fit?

Quick Quiz (5)
1. What is one risk when scaling a model up or down? (short answer)
2. Name two checks to perform before printing multi-part models. (short answer)
3. How should you record filament usage? (short answer)
4. Why document construction steps? (one sentence)
5. What is one visual sign a part needs more infill? (one sentence)

Extension Problems (5)
1. Create a small assembly guide with tactile cues for non-visual users.
2. Produce two scaled variants and compare required print time and fit.
3. Modify a part to include snap-fit connectors and document fit tolerances.
4. Add simple labeling to parts using embossed text in OpenSCAD.
5. Publish your variant and short build notes to the class repo and review two peers’ submissions.
