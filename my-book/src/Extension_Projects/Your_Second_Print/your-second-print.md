# Real-Life Problem Solver — Guided Extension (Self-Paced)

**Accessibility:** When including images or diagrams, add short alt-text and provide a comment-based walkthrough for any .scad examples so screen-reader users can follow the design steps.


Estimated time: 4–8 hours (design, adapt, print, and document)

**Learning Objectives**
- Identify a user problem and evaluate candidate printed solutions
- Adapt an existing model to meet real constraints and safety requirements
- Test, measure, and iterate on a prototype with documented decisions

**Materials**
- Computer with slicer and access to repositories
- Printer, filament, basic hand tools for post-processing

Step-by-step Tasks
1. Interview a potential user (or yourself) and write a 1-paragraph problem statement.
2. Search repositories for candidate models; list three options and justify which one you will adapt.
3. Adapt the model (scale, add mounts, or modify features) and document the changes in a short changelog.
4. Slice, print, and run a supervised test of the prototype; log any failures and corrective actions.
5. Produce a final report summarizing performance, measured deviations, and next steps.

Probing Questions
- What assumptions did you make about the user's context? How could you validate them?
- Which adaptation had the biggest impact on function and why?

Quick Quiz (5)
1. What is a good first question to ask a stakeholder when scoping this project? (short answer)
2. Name one safety consideration when adapting a model for daily use. (short answer)
3. What is a changelog entry? (one sentence)
4. How do you verify a fit for an assembled part? (short answer)
5. Why document corrective actions during testing? (one sentence)

Extension Problems (5)
1. Rework your prototype to improve durability and report trade-offs in weight and print time.
2. Create a user test script and run it with two participants; summarize results.
3. Convert a critical component to parametric OpenSCAD and publish the variant.
4. Add a small assembly guide with tactile cues for non-visual users.
5. Compare two filament types for the same part and recommend one with justification.

**Deliverables**
- Problem statement, changelog, print logs, photos, and final report.
