/*
Rotating a 3D Model
Let's create a cube and then rotate it by 45 degrees about the Z-axis.
*/


/*
Right Hand Rule
Let's rotate our cube by 45 degrees around the X, Y, and Z axis one at a time to understand the right hand rule.
*/

// Around X-axis

// Around Y-axis

// Around Z-axis

/*
Multiple rotations
Let's now rotate the cube by 30 degrees around the X-axis, 60 degrees around the Y-axis and 90 degrees around the Z-axis all at once.
