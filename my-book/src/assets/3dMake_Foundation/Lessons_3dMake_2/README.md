# Lesson 2: Geometric Primitives and Constructive Solid Geometry

**Estimated time:** 60 minutes

## Folder Contents

This folder contains supporting materials for Lesson 2:

- **Starter Code:** Example snippets for primitives and CSG operations
- **Extension Projects:** YourSecondPrint and BonusPrint for real-world application
- **Reference Materials:** OpenSCAD cheat sheet, slicer validation guides

## Learning Objectives

- Use OpenSCAD primitives: `cube()`, `sphere()`, `cylinder()`
- Apply CSG operators: `union`, `difference`, `intersection`
- Diagnose and fix common geometry issues
- Validate geometry in a slicer

## Key Materials

- [Lesson 2 Main Content](../../../3dMakeFoundation/Lessons3dMake2/Lessons3dMake2.md)
- [OpenSCAD Cheat Sheet](../../../3dMakeFoundation/Lessons3dMake2/openscad-cheat-sheet.md)
- [Appendix A: Comprehensive Slicing Guide](../../../3dMakeFoundation/AppendixAComprehensiveSlicingGuide.md)

## Extension Projects in This Folder

### YourSecondPrint

**Purpose:** Adapt existing models to meet real-world needs; practice iteration and documentation

**Time:** 4-8 hours (design, adapt, print, document)

**Skills Developed:**
- Model evaluation and adaptation
- Parametric modification
- Iterative design and testing
- Documentation and changelog practices

### BonusPrint

**Purpose:** Scaling and simple modifications; multi-part printing and documentation

**Time:** 2-3 hours

**Skills Developed:**
- Model scaling and resizing
- Multi-part workflow
- Print organization and tracking

## Quick Start

1. Complete Lesson 2, referencing the OpenSCAD Cheat Sheet
2. Work through YourSecondPrint to practice model adaptation
3. Use Appendix A for slicer validation techniques
4. (Optional) Complete BonusPrint for additional scaling practice
