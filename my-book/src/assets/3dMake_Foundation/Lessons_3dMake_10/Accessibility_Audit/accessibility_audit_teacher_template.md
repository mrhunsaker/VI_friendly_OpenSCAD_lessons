# Accessibility Audit - Teacher Template (Extension Project) {#assets_3dmake_foundation_lessons_3dmake_10_accessibility_audit-accessibility_audit_teacher_template}

## Briefing

Students conduct a comprehensive accessibility audit of 3D printing workflows and tools. This project emphasizes universal design principles, accessibility testing, and inclusive documentation.

**Key Learning:** Accessibility as a design practice; testing with assistive technology; inclusive documentation.

**Real-world Connection:** Universal design benefits all users. Accessibility is increasingly a legal and ethical requirement in professional contexts.

## Constraints
- Audit must cover at least three tools or workflows (editor, slicer, terminal)
- Testing must include both automated checks and user feedback
- Recommendations must be specific and actionable
- Documentation must support future accessibility improvements

## Functional Requirements
- Audit identifies specific accessibility barriers with clear descriptions
- Testing conducted with screen reader and keyboard-only navigation
- Recommendations are prioritized by impact and feasibility
- Documentation guides future accessibility improvements

## Deliverables
- Completed audit template
- Detailed findings for each tool/workflow
- Screen reader testing log
- Recommendations matrix (priority, feasibility, impact)
- Reflection on accessibility challenges and opportunities
- Action plan for improving course materials

## Rubric
