# Accessibility Audit — Extension Project 

**Estimated time:** 2–4 hours

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:
- Evaluate digital content for accessibility barriers related to vision, blindness, and low vision
- Apply concrete accessibility best practices (alt-text, code comments, clear language)
- Document improvements and estimate implementation effort
- Strengthen your awareness of inclusive design principles

## Objective
- Evaluate one lesson or project for non-visual accessibility and produce a prioritized improvement plan.

## Tasks
1. Select one lesson or project (OpenSCAD file + markdown instructions) and review for accessibility shortcomings.
2. Create a short checklist (images alt-text, code walkthroughs, tactile cues, file naming) and apply it to the chosen resource.
3. Implement at least three small improvements (alt text, clearer code comments, or a text-only walkthrough) and document changes.
4. Produce a summary with suggested larger changes and an estimate of the instructor time to implement them.

## Deliverable
- A one-page audit report and a patch (diff) suggestion for the target lesson.

## Starter files
- [starter.scad](../../assets/Extension_Projects/Accessibility_Audit/starter.scad) — small tactile marker scaffold for testing contrast and tactile cues.

## Assessment Questions (Optional)
1. What are three key accessibility barriers you discovered in your chosen resource?
2. Which of your three improvements was easiest to implement, and which was most challenging?
3. How could the instructor prioritize large-scale accessibility improvements across the entire course?
