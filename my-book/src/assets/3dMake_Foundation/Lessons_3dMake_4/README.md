# Lesson 4: AI-Enhanced Verification and Multimodal Feedback

**Estimated time:** 60-90 minutes

## Folder Contents

This folder contains supporting materials for Lesson 4:

- **Extension Projects:** DiceDiceDice for practical testing and validation
- **Reference Materials:** Master Rubric for design assessment
- **Templates:** Design validation worksheets and feedback forms

## Learning Objectives

- Use AI tools for model inspection and improvement
- Interpret multimodal feedback (visual, textual, mathematical)
- Implement improvements based on AI suggestions
- Create robust, testable designs

## Key Materials

- [Lesson 4 Main Content](../../../3dMakeFoundation/Lessons3dMake4/Lessons3dMake4.md)
- [Master Rubric](../../../3dMakeFoundation/Lessons3dMake11/master-rubric.md) - Design quality evaluation criteria

## Extension Projects in This Folder

### DiceDiceDice

**Purpose:** Parametric design with testing and validation; introduces experimental methodology

**Time:** 4-6 hours

**Skills Developed:**
- Parametric design for variants
- Mass and distribution testing
- Statistical analysis of print results
- Design validation through physical testing

**Key Deliverables:**
- Multiple dice variants with documented parameters
- Test results and measurements
- Analysis of print quality variations
