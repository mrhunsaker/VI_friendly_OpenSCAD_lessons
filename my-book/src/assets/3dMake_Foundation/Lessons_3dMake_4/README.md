# Lesson 4: AI-Enhanced Verification and Multimodal Feedback

**Estimated time:** 60–90 minutes

## Folder Contents

This folder contains supporting materials for Lesson 4:

- **Extension Projects:** Dice_Dice_Dice for practical testing and validation
- **Reference Materials:** Master Rubric for design assessment
- **Templates:** Design validation worksheets and feedback forms

## Learning Objectives

- Use AI tools for model inspection and improvement
- Interpret multimodal feedback (visual, textual, mathematical)
- Implement improvements based on AI suggestions
- Create robust, testable designs

## Key Materials

- [Lesson 4 Main Content](../../3dMake_Foundation/Lessons_3dMake_4/Lessons_3dMake_4.md)
- [Master Rubric](../../../Reference_Materials/master-rubric.md) — Design quality evaluation criteria
