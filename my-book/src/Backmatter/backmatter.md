## How to use these appendices

- Each appendix is intended as a focused reference you can consult when you need extra detail beyond the course material.
- They are ordered in the book's SUMMARY so they will appear after the main lessons and can be built separately or merged into the full PDF output.

- **Glossary and Index:**
  - The glossary collects short definitions and cross-references to chapters where terms appear.
  - The index is produced as a separate backmatter component and may be generated during PDF build using pandoc's raw LaTeX index commands or a separate index generation step (for example, tagging terms with index markers and running `makeindex` during the LaTeX build).
