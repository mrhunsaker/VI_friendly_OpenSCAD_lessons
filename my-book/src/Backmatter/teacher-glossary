# 1. General Design & Engineering Concepts

## Additive Manufacturing
**Definition:** Manufacturing process that builds objects layer by layer.

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Contrast with subtractive manufacturing (CNC milling). Students should understand material addition vs removal.

**Common Misconception:**  
Students often assume “3D printing” is a single technology; clarify FDM vs resin vs industrial processes.

**Demonstration:**  
Show failed print cross-section to visualize layers.

**Assessment Cue:**  
Can student explain how layer height affects surface quality?

---

## Parametric Design
**Definition:** Designing models driven by adjustable variables.

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
This is the core philosophical difference between OpenSCAD and GUI CAD tools.

**Common Misconception:**  
Students confuse “parameter” with “hardcoded variable.” Emphasize reusability.

**Demonstration:**  
Live-edit a dimension variable and re-render.

**Assessment Cue:**  
Can student refactor a fixed-dimension model into a parametric one?

---

## Tolerance
**Definition:** Acceptable dimensional variation to ensure parts fit.

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Tie directly to printer calibration and material shrinkage.

**Common Misconception:**  
Students assume digital dimensions equal physical results.

**Demonstration:**  
Print tolerance test blocks.

**Assessment Cue:**  
Can student calculate clearance needed for a press fit?

---

# 2. 3D Printing (FDM)

## Layer Height
**Definition:** Vertical thickness of each printed layer.

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Trade-off between print speed and surface quality.

**Common Misconception:**  
Lower layer height does not automatically mean stronger prints.

**Demonstration:**  
Compare 0.2mm vs 0.1mm prints.

**Assessment Cue:**  
Can student justify layer height choice for functional vs aesthetic part?

---

## Infill
**Definition:** Internal support structure expressed as a percentage.

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Strength comes from perimeters + infill pattern choice.

**Common Misconception:**  
Students assume 100% infill = strongest in all cases.

**Demonstration:**  
Cut apart failed prints to show internal structure.

**Assessment Cue:**  
Can student select appropriate infill for load-bearing bracket?

---

## Warping
**Definition:** Edge lifting due to uneven cooling.

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Connect to material properties (PLA vs ABS).

**Assessment Cue:**  
Can student propose mitigation strategies (brim, enclosure, temperature)?

---

# 3. OpenSCAD — Modeling & Language

## CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry)
**Definition:** Modeling by combining primitives with boolean operations.

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Encourage students to think in logical operations, not sculpting.

**Common Misconception:**  
Students attempt to “draw” instead of combining primitives.

**Demonstration:**  
Build a complex object from cube + cylinder + difference().

**Assessment Cue:**  
Can student decompose a real-world object into primitives?

---

## Module
**Definition:** Reusable block of geometry.

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Modules = abstraction. Introduce early to prevent code duplication.

**Common Misconception:**  
Students treat modules as simple macros; clarify parameter scope.

**Assessment Cue:**  
Can student create a reusable module with defaults?

---

## $fn
**Definition:** Resolution variable controlling roundness.

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Performance vs visual quality trade-off.

**Demonstration:**  
Render cylinder with $fn=20 vs 100.

**Assessment Cue:**  
Can student explain why high $fn slows render time?

---

## Preview vs Render
**Definition:** F5 (preview) vs F6 (full geometry evaluation).

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Preview ≠ printable model.

**Common Misconception:**  
Students export from preview state without full render.

**Assessment Cue:**  
Does student verify manifold geometry before export?

---

# 4. 3dMake & Automation

## Headless Rendering
**Definition:** Running OpenSCAD via command line without GUI.

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Reproducibility and automation are professional practices.

**Demonstration:**  
Run OpenSCAD CLI from PowerShell.

**Assessment Cue:**  
Can student produce STL via script without GUI?

---

## Reproducible Build
**Definition:** Identical output from version-controlled inputs.

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Critical for collaboration and grading consistency.

**Assessment Cue:**  
Can another student regenerate identical artifact from repo?

---

# 5. Command Line & Shell

## Environment Variable
**Definition:** Named value available to processes (e.g., PATH).

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Students must understand PATH for CLI tools.

**Common Misconception:**  
Confusion between system vs user variables.

**Assessment Cue:**  
Can student diagnose “command not found” error?

---

## Exit Code
**Definition:** Numeric return status of command (0 = success).

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Foundation for scripting logic.

**Assessment Cue:**  
Can student use conditional logic based on exit status?

---

## Pipe
**Definition:** Redirect output of one command into another.

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Core Unix philosophy — small tools combined.

**Demonstration:**  
`Get-ChildItem | Select-String`

---

# 6. PowerShell-Specific

## Cmdlet
**Definition:** Native PowerShell command.

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Verb-Noun naming convention.

# 7. Git & Version Control

## Commit
**Definition:** Snapshot of project state.

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Encourage small, meaningful commits.

**Assessment Cue:**  
Does student use descriptive commit messages?

## Semantic Structure
**Definition:** Logical heading hierarchy in Markdown/HTML.

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Accessibility and maintainability.

---

# 9. Safety & Risk

## Hierarchy of Controls
**Definition:** Safety prioritization model (eliminate → PPE).

**Teaching Emphasis:**  
Ventilation > mask alone.

---

# 10. AI & Generative Design (Advanced)

## Prompt Engineering
