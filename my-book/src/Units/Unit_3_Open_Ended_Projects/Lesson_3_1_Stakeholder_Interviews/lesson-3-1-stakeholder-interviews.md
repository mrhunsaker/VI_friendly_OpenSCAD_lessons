## Step‑by‑Step Activities

1) Prepare (15–20 min)
   - Read the short definition of "stakeholder" and the Wants/Needs/Constraints table.
   - Select or be assigned a stakeholder scenario (see Practice Activity below) or find a real stakeholder.
   - Draft 5–8 open-ended questions using the worksheet.

2) Conduct the interview (10–15 min)
   - Introduce yourself, state the purpose, and ask for permission to record or take notes.
   - Ask your planned questions and follow-up with "why" and silence when appropriate.
   - Capture specific details, numbers, and stories.

3) Immediate synthesis (15–20 min)
   - Within 30 minutes, fill in the After-the-Interview section on the worksheet.
   - Identify Wants, Needs, and Constraints and write a 2–3 sentence problem statement.

4) Write functional requirements (20–30 min)
   - Convert each Need into a testable functional requirement using the template.
   - Aim for 4–8 requirements that collectively define success for the stakeholder.

5) Peer review or instructor check (optional)
   - Exchange requirements with a classmate and attempt to write a short pass/fail test for each requirement.

Checkpoint: You are done with this lesson when you have a completed worksheet with interview notes, a clear problem statement, and 4–8 functional requirements.

## What Is a Stakeholder?

A **stakeholder** is anyone who has a meaningful interest in the outcome of a design — anyone who will be affected by whether it works well or poorly.

In Project 2, your stakeholders will be real people with real problems:
- A student who needs a sock holder
- A model rocketry enthusiast who needs a component
- Someone in your school community who has a physical need you can address

Your job as the designer is not to guess what they need — it's to **ask** and **listen**.

---

## Why Interviewing Matters

The most common design failure is solving the wrong problem. A designer who jumps straight to building often creates something technically impressive that doesn't actually meet the user's real need.

Consider this scenario: A person says they need a "better way to organize their desk." An impulsive designer immediately starts designing a fancy pencil holder. But through an interview, you discover they spend 10 minutes every morning looking for their phone charger — the real problem is cable management, not pencils.

**The interview is how you find out what problem you're actually solving.**

---

## Wants, Needs, and Constraints

Before you design anything, you need to sort stakeholder input into three categories:

| Category | Definition | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Need** | Must-have; the design fails without it | "It has to hold the socks flat so they don't bunch" |
| **Want** | Nice-to-have; improves the design but not essential | "I'd love it if it came in blue" |
| **Constraint** | A limitation you must work within | "It has to fit on a shelf that's 15 cm deep" |

When you write **functional requirements**, you are turning needs into testable statements. A well-written functional requirement:
- Describes **what** the design must do (not **how** it does it)
- Is specific enough that you can test pass/fail
- Does not assume a particular solution

**Examples:**

| Bad (assumes solution) | Good (testable behavior) |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| "Must have velcro" | "Must be removable and re-attachable without tools" |
| "Should be made of PLA" | "Must withstand foot traffic from furniture" |
| "Needs to look nice" | "Must be unobtrusive enough that visitors don't notice it" |

## How to Conduct a Stakeholder Interview

### Before the Interview

1. Learn as much as you can about the person's situation beforehand
2. Write 5–10 open-ended questions (questions that can't be answered with just "yes" or "no")
3. Bring paper and something to write with — or ask permission to record

### During the Interview

**Opening:** Introduce yourself and explain the purpose. Tell them there are no right or wrong answers — you're here to learn from them, not to show them a design.

**Core questions to adapt to your situation:**

1. *Can you describe what you do / how you use [relevant object/space]?* (Open, context-setting)
2. *What works well about the current situation? What doesn't work?* (Uncovers real pain points)
3. *Walk me through a time when [the problem] caused you difficulty.* (Gets specific stories instead of vague generalities)
4. *What would an ideal solution look like to you?* (Their "want")
5. *Are there any limitations or requirements I should know about?* (Uncovers constraints)
6. *Is there anything about this problem I haven't asked about?* (Closing — leaves room for things you didn't know to ask)

**Techniques:**
- **Let silence work.** When the person pauses, don't rush to fill the silence — often their best answer comes after they think for a moment.
- **Ask "why."** If someone says something surprising, gently ask why that matters to them.
- **Don't suggest solutions yet.** If you say "would a velcro holder help?" you've already biased their answer.
- **Take notes on specific details** — measurements, phrases they use, stories. Details make better designs than generalities.

### After the Interview

Immediately after (within 30 minutes while it's fresh), write a one-page summary including:
- Who you interviewed and their role
- The core problem as you understand it
- Their wants, needs, and constraints
- Any surprising things you learned
- Questions you still have

---

## Writing Functional Requirements

After your interview, convert your findings into functional requirements. Use this format:

> **The [object] must [action/behavior] [measurable condition].**

Examples:
- The sock holder must keep socks flat and paired without folding them over.
- The sock holder must attach to a standard closet rod without tools.
- The sock holder must not damage the socks when removing them.
- The sock holder must fit standard adult sock sizes (up to size 13).

The goal is to write 4–8 functional requirements that fully describe what "success" looks like for your stakeholder. Your final design will be evaluated against these requirements.

---

## Practice Activity: Mini Interview

In pairs, one person plays a "stakeholder" with one of the following scenarios (instructor's choice), and the other plays the designer:

- **Scenario A:** A student who has trouble finding items in their backpack and keeps losing small items
- **Scenario B:** A teacher who wants a better way to organize cords on their desk
- **Scenario C:** A student who uses mobility aids and finds standard desk design awkward

**Interviewer:** Conduct a 5-minute interview using the techniques above. Take notes.

**After the interview:** Write 4 functional requirements based on what you learned.

**Debrief:** Switch roles and repeat with a different scenario.

---

## Quiz (5 questions — short answers)

1. What is the primary purpose of a stakeholder interview? (one sentence)
2. Give one example of a "constraint."
3. Rewrite this vague need into a testable functional requirement: "It should be easy to remove items."
4. Name two interviewing techniques that encourage more useful responses.
5. What should you do within 30 minutes after an interview, and why?

Answer key (instructor use):
1. To discover the real problem and user needs through listening.
2. Example: Maximum width 15 cm / Budget under $10 / Must fit in a locker.
3. Example: "The organizer must allow a user to remove items with one hand within 2 seconds."
4. Let silence; ask "why"; avoid suggesting solutions.
5. Write a one-page summary while details are fresh, to preserve specifics and measurable constraints.

---

## Extension Problems (apply skills independently)

1. Adapt your interview plan to a remote interview (phone or video). List 5 changes you would make and why.
2. From a previous interview, create an empathy map (what they say, think, do, feel) and derive two additional requirements.
3. Design a 3-question follow-up survey to validate one high-priority requirement with 20 users.
4. Convert a "want" from an interview into an optional feature and propose a low-cost prototype to test it.
5. Choose a new stakeholder group (e.g., custodial staff) and write three interview questions tailored to their constraints.

## Practice Scoring Rubric (informal)

- Completed worksheet and problem statement: 3 points
- 4–8 clear functional requirements, testable: 4 points
- Evidence of ethical interviewing (consent noted, respectful behavior): 1 point
- Peer review or instructor check completed: 1 point

Total: 9 points
