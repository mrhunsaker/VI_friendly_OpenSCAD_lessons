# Project 1 — Tactile Floor Markers (Guided Self-Paced)

Estimated time: 1–2 weeks (self-paced milestones suggested)

**Accessibility:** Provide alt-text for images and a short comment-based walkthrough in `.scad` files so screen-reader users can follow steps.

## Materials

- Calipers, classroom printer, example prototypes, project documentation template

## Objectives

- Translate functional requirements into measurable acceptance tests
- Produce parametric OpenSCAD models that support rapid prototyping

## Sequence (approx. 2 weeks)

1. Read the briefing and write five functional requirements; for each, state a single testable acceptance criterion.
2. Measure the target surface and record constraints (dimensions, surface material, and access).
3. Sketch three concept variations and pick one to implement in `project1.scad` using top-level variables.
4. Print a low-resolution tactile prototype (print only a small section if necessary) and evaluate feel and placement.
5. Iterate: update parameters and print a second prototype; measure and document changes.
6. Finalize the marker and produce assembly/installation notes and a short reflection on accessibility testing.

## Instructor notes

- Assessment checklist:
- Model meets acceptance tests for at least three functional requirements
- Iteration documented with measurable changes
- Clear reflection on what changed and why

Probing Questions
1. Which functional requirement is hardest to verify non-visually and how will you test it?
2. How does surface texture affect tactile recognition for your marker design?

Extension problems (5):
1. Design a removable attachment for the marker that requires no tools and document tolerance choices.
2. Create three tactile variants and run blind tests with two participants; summarize results.
3. Add embossed labels and measure how text depth influences tactile recognition.
4. Model and test mounting on a curved surface and report fit adjustments.
5. Produce a short guide for non-visual users to test and validate tactile markers.


**Assessment checklist (instructor)**

- Model meets at least three acceptance tests
- Two iterations documented with measurable changes
- Reflection includes concrete next-step adjustments and accessibility outcomes

**Accessibility:** When including sample images or slicer screenshots, add a short alt-text description and provide a comment-based walkthrough for any example .scad files so screen-reader users can follow step-by-step.
