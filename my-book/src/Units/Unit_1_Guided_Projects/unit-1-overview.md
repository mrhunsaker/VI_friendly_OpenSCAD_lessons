# Unit 1: Guided Projects (Self-Paced primer)

**Accessibility:** When including sample images or slicer screenshots, add a short alt-text description and provide a comment-based walkthrough for any example `.scad` files so screen-reader users can follow step-by-step.

Estimated duration: 3–4 weeks (self-paced students may compress or expand)

Purpose: Guide independent learners through project-driven skill application, with clear checkpoints, quizzes, and extension problems to build mastery and independence.

How to use this unit (self-paced):
- Complete the short lessons in `Unit_1_Guided_Projects` before starting each project.
- Follow the step-by-step project guides (`Project_0.md`, `Project_1.md`) and submit deliverables listed in each project.
- After each milestone (measure, model, render, slice, print), complete the quick checkpoint and quiz.

Core projects in this unit:
- Project 0 — Your First 3D Print (1–2 lab sessions): practice measurement, parametric modeling, and slicing.
- Project 1 — Tactile Floor Marker (approx. 2 weeks): design to functional requirements and iterate.
- Extensions — small, optional projects for additional practice.

Self-paced checkpoints and assessment:
- Each lesson file includes a short quiz (5 items) and 5 extension problems — complete the quiz and at least 2 extension problems for mastery evidence.
- Projects list clear deliverables; use the assessment checklists in each project to self-evaluate before submission.

Accessibility and adaptations:
- Use tactile prototypes or scaled test prints for students using non-visual access methods.
- Encourage the use of accessible slicer workflows (CLI-based slicing or accessible GUI tools) and document the steps in the student template.

Teacher / mentor guidance (if available):
- Schedule at least one short review session per project for quick feedback on measurements and first prototype fit.
- For students working fully independently, require that they submit the documentation template and at least one photo or STL for review.
