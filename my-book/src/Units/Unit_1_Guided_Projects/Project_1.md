# Project 1 — Tactile Floor Markers

## Materials

- Failed 3D printed prototypes for examples
- Example project documentation and briefing files
- Calipers
- An environment (real or simulated) for placing floor markers

## Objectives

- Design and iterate on a tactile floor marker that meets functional requirements
- Produce technical documentation and measurement data
- Test prototypes and refine designs across iterations

## Sequence (approx. 2 weeks)

1. Read the design briefing and clarify functional requirements.
2. Sketch concepts and take measurements of target surfaces.
3. Implement a chosen design in OpenSCAD using variables for major dimensions.
4. Print prototypes, evaluate against acceptance criteria, and iterate.
5. Finalize documentation, take at least one photo of the physical device, and submit deliverables.

## Instructor notes

- Encourage multiple quick iterations with low `SHELL` settings for faster printing when testing fit.
- Emphasize documentation: students should include measured values, code, print settings, and reflections.
# Project 1 Tactile Floor Markers

## Materials
- Failed 3d printed prototype
- Example Project doc file
- Project briefing file
- Callipers
- A room with furniture that can be moved and needs to be put back in place (this can be made up, but its helpful if its a real life example or use for students)

## Objectives
- 3D printing 
- Designing a solution based on functional requirements and constraints
- Preparing technical notes
- Meauring using calipers
- Testing multiple iterations

## Sequence
*Project should take around 2 weeks*
1. Have student read the design briefing.
2. Have students sketch out some ideas and take measurements.
3. Have students pick the idea they would like to implement and begin programming it.
4. Have students 3D print their prototype and evaluate it against the projects functional requirements and criteria.
5. Have students reiterate on their prototype. 
6. Have students finish their documentation file and take atleast one product photo. 
7. Have students send all virutal deliverables via email and present the physical device in class.
