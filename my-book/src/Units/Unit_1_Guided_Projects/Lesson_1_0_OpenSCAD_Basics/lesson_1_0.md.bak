## Lesson 1.0 — OpenSCAD Basics

### Materials

- Ruler / calipers
- Computer with OpenSCAD installed
- (Optional) Braille display or other assistive hardware

### Overview

This lesson introduces the OpenSCAD workflow and the editor environment. Students will create their first shape (`cube()`), learn how to add comments, and understand the difference between previewing and fully rendering a model for export.

### Sequence & Notes

- What is OpenSCAD: code-driven 3D modelling, parametric design, advantages for reproducibility and accessibility.
- OpenSCAD terminology: module, primitive, variable, parameter, preview vs render.
- Comments: single-line (`// comment`) and block (`/* comment */`) comments for documenting code.
- Helpful editor features: syntax highlighting, find/replace, indentation — recommend using VSCode or Notepad++ for larger projects.
- The OpenSCAD editor layout: code editor (left), 3D preview (right), console (bottom).
- Your first shape: `cube([length, width, height]);` — practice creating and previewing a cube.
- Preview vs Render: `F5` for preview (fast), `F6` for full render (required before export).
- Export: File → Export → Export as STL after a full render.
- Units: OpenSCAD treats numeric values as unit-less; treat them as millimeters for 3D printing projects.

### Classroom Activities

1. Open OpenSCAD, create a new file, and type the example cube code. Press `F5` to preview.
2. Change the cube dimensions using named variables and re-preview.
3. Save the file and perform a full render (`F6`) and export to STL.

### Check for understanding

- What is a comment and how do you add one in OpenSCAD?
- What is the difference between `F5` and `F6`?
- Why do we treat numbers as millimeters in these lessons?

### Quiz — Lesson 1.0

1. Short answer: How do you write a single-line comment in OpenSCAD? (Answer: `// comment`)
2. Multiple choice: Which key performs a fast preview? (A) F5  (B) F6  (C) Ctrl+S  — Answer: A
3. True/False: You must do a full render before exporting an STL. — Answer: True
4. Short answer: Give one reason why OpenSCAD is useful for reproducible designs.
5. Practical: Write code for a cube that is 40 mm × 20 mm × 10 mm and render it.
