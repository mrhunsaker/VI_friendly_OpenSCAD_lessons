# Unit 2 — Problem Finding & Stakeholder Design (Self-Paced)
**Accessibility:** When including sample images or slicer screenshots, add a short alt-text description and provide a comment-based walkthrough for any example `.scad` files so screen-reader users can follow step-by-step.
**Duration:** 3 weeks  
**Driving Question:** How do you design something for someone else's needs, not your own assumptions?

## Unit Summary
Unit 2 introduces students to the human side of design. Up to this point students have been given requirements — now they must discover them. This unit teaches stakeholder interviewing, need-finding, and the discipline of designing for someone else's context rather than their own. Students also expand their OpenSCAD skills with loops and arrays to handle more complex geometry. The unit culminates in Project 2, where students work with an actual external stakeholder.

## Lessons

### Lesson 2.1 — How to Interview a Stakeholder
**Objective:** Students can conduct a structured stakeholder interview and convert the results into a written list of functional requirements.

**Topics:**
- What a stakeholder is and why their perspective drives the design
- The difference between what someone *asks for* and what they *need*
- Good interview questions: open-ended, functional, "how would you know if it worked?"
- Bad interview questions: leading, aesthetic, solution-first ("Should it be blue or red?")
- How to write up interview notes and extract requirements

**Activity:** Role-play in pairs. One student plays a stakeholder with a prepared scenario card (e.g., "I need something to hold my earbuds so I don't lose them on my desk"), the other plays the designer. Students conduct a 5-minute interview, then write up 3–5 functional requirements from their notes. Switch roles and repeat. Debrief as a class.

**Vocabulary:** stakeholder, need-finding, open-ended question, design brief

**Unit 2 — Problem Finding & Stakeholder Design (Self-Paced Unit Overview)**

Estimated total time: 3 weeks (self-paced pacing — break into 4–6 shorter work blocks)

How to complete this unit (student checklist):
1. Read the Unit Overview and review the driving question.
2. Complete Lesson 2.1 (stakeholder interviewing) and submit interview notes and functional requirements.
3. Complete Lesson 2.2 (parametric loops) and submit a refactored `.scad` using modules.
4. Complete Lessons 2.3 and 2.4 (constraints, iteration) and run the Project 2 stakeholder check-ins and iterations.
5. Submit Project 2 deliverables: stakeholder notes, at least two printed iterations, code, and final reflection.

Checkpoint (before Project 2):
- Upload your stakeholder interview notes and a short design brief (1 paragraph) summarizing the user's needs and constraints.

Unit quiz (5 items):
1. Short answer: What is the difference between a stakeholder's 'ask' and their real 'need'?
2. Multiple choice: Why use loops in OpenSCAD? (A) To make models look nicer (B) To repeat geometry without copy‑paste (C) To export STL) — Answer: B
3. Short answer: Name two environmental constraints that might affect a design.
4. Practical: Provide a one‑sentence design brief for the sample stakeholder: "I need something to hold my earbuds so I don't lose them on my desk." Include two functional requirements.
5. Reflection: Describe what 'sign-off' from a stakeholder means in one sentence.

Extension activities (5):
1. Draft three alternative interview questions that are open‑ended and nonleading for the earbuds stakeholder.
2. Create a parametric module for a small storage box and publish three size variants with a short README explaining the parameters.
3. Run a user observation (5 minutes) on a classmate performing a related task and record one hidden need you observed.
4. Take one prototype, iterate it twice based on mock stakeholder feedback, and attach photos or STL files of each iteration.
5. Produce a one‑page accessibility checklist for your Project 2 design (how would a blind user interact with your object?).

**Accessibility:** When including sample images or slicer screenshots, add a short alt-text description and provide a comment-based walkthrough for any example .scad files so screen-reader users can follow step-by-step.
