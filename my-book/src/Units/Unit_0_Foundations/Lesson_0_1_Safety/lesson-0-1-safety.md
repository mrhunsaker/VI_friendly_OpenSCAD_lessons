## Why Safety Matters in 3D Printing

FDM 3D printers are generally safe tools, but they involve **high temperatures, moving parts, and airborne particles** that require awareness and respect. Even PLA — the most common filament and one often described as "safe" — releases ultrafine particles and trace volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when melted. In a classroom setting with multiple students and printers, proper ventilation and habits matter.

Key hazards to understand:

**Heat.** The nozzle operates between 190°C and 230°C, and the print bed can reach 60°C or higher. Both cause serious burns on contact. The hotend retains heat for several minutes after printing stops.

**Moving parts.** The printhead and bed move quickly and precisely. Reaching into an operating printer can cause injury or damage the machine.

**Fumes and particles.** All melted plastics release ultrafine particles (UFPs). Ventilation is required. PLA is among the lowest-emission options, but even PLA should not be printed in an unventilated space. ABS, Nylon, and flexible filaments (TPU) emit more. Never stand directly over a running printer and inhale the output.

**Filament.** Strands and broken pieces of filament are sharp. Sharp off-cuts and failed prints should be disposed of properly, not left on work surfaces.

**Fire.** While rare, 3D printers should never be left unattended overnight. Always know where the fire extinguisher is located.

## Classroom Safety Rules

1. **Do not touch the nozzle, hot end, or heated bed** while the printer is on or has recently run. Ask the instructor to confirm it has cooled before touching.
2. **Do not reach into the printer** while it is operating.
3. **Do not stand over the printer and breathe the output** for extended periods. The printer area should have ventilation.
4. **Only the instructor (or a trained, authorized student) starts and stops prints.** This rule may evolve as your skills develop.
5. **No food or drink near the printers.** Ultrafine particles can settle on surfaces.
6. **Wash your hands** after handling filament, printed objects, or the printer.
7. **Report damage immediately.** A damaged nozzle, broken wires, or a misaligned bed can cause failed prints or unsafe conditions.
8. **Do not leave a print unattended for long periods.** Check in regularly.
9. **Power off the printer before doing any maintenance or cleaning** (this is done by the instructor).
10. **Know the location of the fire extinguisher, eyewash station, and first aid kit.**

## Printer Orientation Walkthrough

Your instructor will lead a physical walkthrough of the printer. As they point to each part, identify it and record it below.

| Part | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| Print bed (build plate) | Surface where the object is built up layer by layer |
| Nozzle / hot end | Melts and extrudes the filament |
| Extruder | Feeds filament into the hot end |
| X/Y/Z axes | The three directions the print head can move |
| Filament spool holder | Holds the roll of filament |
| Control panel / display | Used to start prints, set temperatures, etc. |
| USB/SD card port | Where you load your sliced G-code file |
| Power switch | Turns the printer on and off |

## Deliverable

Complete the **Safety Checklist** (see `safety-checklist.md` in this folder) and return it to your instructor signed. No further work in the printer space will be permitted without a completed checklist on file.
