# Unit 0: Foundations (Self-Paced Primer)

**Accessibility:** When including sample images or slicer screenshots, add a short alt-text description and provide a comment-based walkthrough for any example `.scad` files so screen-reader users can follow step-by-step.

Estimated duration: 1–2 weeks (self-paced learners may compress or expand tasks)

Purpose: Provide independent learners with step-by-step lessons, quick checkpoints, a unit quiz, and extension problems that build toward Project 0: Measure and Recreate.

How to use this unit:
- Complete Lessons 0.1–0.6 in order. Each lesson includes a short step-by-step activity, a 5-question quiz, and 5 extension problems.
- Complete the safety checklist in `Lesson_0_1_Safety/safety-checklist.md` before any hands-on work.
- After finishing the lessons, complete `Project 0` following the Project 0 instructions in this folder.

Unit learning goals:
- Build a mental model of the full 3D-printing pipeline (measure → model → slice → print)
- Practice accurate measurement with calipers and translate measurements into parametric OpenSCAD code
- Learn basic OpenSCAD commands and transformations needed to recreate simple objects
- Use a slicer (PrusaSlicer) to prepare prints and interpret print estimates

Self-paced checkpoints:
- Each lesson contains a short checkpoint you must complete before proceeding. Keep a copy of your files and submit the deliverables specified in the project instructions.

Accessibility notes:
- Provide tactile examples and low-resolution prototype prints for non-visual learners.
- Use CLI slicing or accessible slicer workflows as needed; include exported textual previews as supplementary material.

Assessment:
- Project 0 is complete/incomplete. Submit `project0.scad`, the exported STL, and the completed documentation template.

**Accessibility:** When including sample images or slicer screenshots, add a short alt-text description and provide a comment-based walkthrough for any example .scad files so screen-reader users can follow step-by-step.
