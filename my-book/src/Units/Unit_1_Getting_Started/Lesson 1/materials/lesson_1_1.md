# Lesson 1_1: Primitives
## Materials
- computer with openSCAD installed
- 3D printed primatives (scale as needed in 3d printer slicer program but keep porportions locked for at least the cylinder and sphere)
- 3D printed 1_1 models

## Sequence
- Warm up review terminology 
- Header Author, date, description fill it out or make one always!
- shape commands parameters and ending with a semi-colon
  - can have any amount of space in the code since all shape commands end with a semi-colon
- cheat sheet for syntax
  - layout of cheat sheet (headings)
  - | or symbol
- the cube continued
  - vectors
  - the center flag (ABC- always be centering!)
- the sphere
  - introduce the $fn code (call it a command for now but explain its actually something else, a reserved variable will learn more about in lesson 1_3 and lesson 2)
- cylinder
  - cones
  
## Check for understanding
- What are parameters?
- Where are each shapes centered
- How do you make a pointed cone facing down?
- Practice problems
