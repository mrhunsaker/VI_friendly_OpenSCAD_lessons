# Project 1 Tactile Floor Markers

## Materials
- Failed 3d printed prototype
- Example Project doc file
- Project briefing file
- Callipers
- A room with furniture that can be moved and needs to be put back in place (this can be made up, but its helpful if its a real life example or use for students)

## Objectives
- 3D printing 
- Designing a solution based on functional requirements and constraints
- Preparing technical notes
- Meauring using calipers
- Testing multiple iterations

## Sequence
*Project should take around 2 weeks*
1. Have student read the design briefing.
2. Have students sketch out some ideas and take measurements.
3. Have students pick the idea they would like to implement and begin programming it.
4. Have students 3D print their prototype and evaluate it against the projects functional requirements and criteria.
5. Have students reiterate on their prototype. 
6. Have students finish their documentation file and take atleast one product photo. 
7. Have students send all virutal deliverables via email and present the physical device in class.
