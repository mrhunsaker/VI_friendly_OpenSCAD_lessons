# Lesson 1_3: Debugging Resolution and translation Pracitce
## Materials
- computer with openSCAD installed
- 3D printed primatives med resolution (scale as needed in 3d printer slicer program but keep porportions locked for atleast the cylinder and sphere)
- 3D printed 1_2 models

## Sequence
- 1_3 Debugging 
  - ctrl alt e and arrow key around if you are getting an error after previewing
  - this lesson just goes over syntax errors for actual bugs check out lesson 2 debugging lesson
- 1_3 Resolution
  - $fn at the top always after header...

## Check for understanding
- What is debugging?
- Why do you need to debug?
- What type of debugging are we going to focus on today?
- What is $fn how does changing it effect your code, the shape,  its rendering/previewing?
