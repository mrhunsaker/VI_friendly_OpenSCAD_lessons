# GitBash-2 through GitBash-6 and Unit Test

*These lesson files will use bash/Unix commands equivalent to the PowerShell and CMD versions. For brevity in this setup, core lesson templates are provided below. Each should adapt the concepts to bash syntax.*

---

## File Naming Convention

- GitBash-2: File and Folder Manipulation (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`)
- GitBash-3: Input, Output & Piping (`|`, `>`, `<`, `grep`, `sort`)
- GitBash-4: Environment Variables & Aliases (`export`, `alias`, `.bashrc`)
- GitBash-5: Filling in the Gaps (Shell profiles, history, debugging)
- GitBash-6: Advanced Terminal Techniques (Shell scripts `.sh`, functions, loops)
- GitBashUnitTest: Comprehensive Practice & Assessment

Each should follow the same structure as PowerShell/CMD equivalents but using bash commands.
