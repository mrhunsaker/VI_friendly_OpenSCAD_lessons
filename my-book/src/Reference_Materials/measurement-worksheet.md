## How to Use This Worksheet

1. Measure each feature **three times** and record all three values
2. Calculate the average: add the three values and divide by 3
3. Round to one decimal place (e.g., 23.4 mm)
4. Use the average in your OpenSCAD code — not a single measurement

**Units:** All measurements in **millimeters (mm)** unless otherwise noted.

## Accuracy Check

After completing all measurements, compare your averages with a partner who measured the same objects.

| Object | My Average (mm) | Partner's Average (mm) | Difference (mm) | Within 1 mm? |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

If any difference is greater than 1 mm, remeasure together and find the source of the discrepancy.

## Percent Error (Optional / Extension)

If your instructor provides the "true" dimension of an object (measured with a reference instrument), you can calculate your percent error:

**Formula:** `% error = (|your average − true value| ÷ true value) × 100`

| Object | Your Average | True Value | Difference | % Error |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

A percent error under 2% is excellent for caliper work at this level.
