- Description: Adapt or modify an existing 3D model to meet a new constraint, improve functionality, or customize for a specific use.

## Ideas and Concept

### Original Model

- Model name and source:
- Link or file reference:
- Why did you choose this model for adaptation?

### Adaptation Goal

- What problem or constraint are you addressing?
- How will you know the adaptation is successful?
- Who will use the adapted model?

## Measurements and Design Specifications

## Object Notes

### Modifications Made

- Describe changes to the original design:
- Did you modify the model in OpenSCAD, slicer, or both?
- Include before/after code snippets or screenshots:

### User Testing (if applicable)

- Who tested the adapted model?
- What feedback did they provide?
- How did this feedback influence your design?

### Assembly and Use Notes

- How is the adapted model assembled or used?
- How does it differ from the original in use?
- What challenges did you encounter?

## Reflections

### Design Evolution
- Describe how your adaptation evolved through the iteration process
- Which iteration felt most successful?

### Lessons Learned
- What did you learn about adapting existing designs?
- What surprised you during the process?

### Comparison: Original vs. Adapted
- What are the key functional differences?
- Would you recommend the adapted version? Why?

### Future Iterations
- If you were to continue developing this, what would you change?
- How could you make the design more parametric or reusable?

### Accessibility Considerations
- How did you approach testing this project with screen readers?
- What documentation would help someone without visual access understand the changes?
