# Project 0: Your First 3D Print - Student Documentation Template {#3dmake_foundation_templates_student-project_0_student_template}

- Author:
- Date:
- Description: Measure a small object, convert measurements into OpenSCAD variables, and print a functional model.

## Ideas and Concept

### Object Selection
- What small object did you choose?
- Why is this object appropriate for a first 3D print?
- What are three key measurable features?

### Design Approach
- What parametric strategy will you use (top-level variables for dimensions)?
- Sketch or describe your planned OpenSCAD structure

## Measurements

### Physical Object (Original)

| Feature | Measurement 1 | Measurement 2 | Measurement 3 | Average |
|---------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Length  |               |               |               |         |
| Width   |               |               |               |         |
| Height  |               |               |               |         |
| (Other) |               |               |               |         |

### Slicer Configuration

- Layer Height: _ mm
- Infill: _ %
- Supports: Yes / No
- Estimated Print Time: _ hours
- Estimated Filament: _ grams

## Object Notes

### Construction Notes
- Describe your OpenSCAD code structure (how you organized variables and primitives)
- What transforms (translate, rotate, scale) did you use?
- Did you use any modules or libraries?

### Printed Part Measurements (After Cooling)

| Feature | Intended (mm) | Printed (mm) | Deviation | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| Length  |               |              |           |       |
| Width   |               |              |           |       |
| Height  |               |              |           |       |
| (Other) |               |              |           |       |

### Assembly / Installation / Use Notes
- How does the printed part fit/function compared to your original object?
- Did it perform as expected? Why or why not?
- What challenges did you face during printing?

## Reflections

### What Went Well
- Which measurement was most accurate and why?
- What aspect of the design worked well in the print?

### What Didn't Go Well
- Which dimension deviated most from the design?
- What do you suspect caused this deviation (printer tolerance, design flaw, material properties, slicer settings)?
- If you could make one adjustment to the code, what would it be?

### Next Steps
- What would you change for a second iteration?
- How would you test your adjustment?

### Accessibility Notes (for screen reader users)
- Describe your OpenSCAD file structure in words so others can follow your design
- What part of the workflow was hardest to navigate without visual feedback?
