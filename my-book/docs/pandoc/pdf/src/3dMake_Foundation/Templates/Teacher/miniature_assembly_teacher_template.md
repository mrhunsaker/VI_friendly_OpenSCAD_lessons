# Miniature Assembly - Teacher Template (Extension Project) {#3dmake_foundation_templates_teacher-miniature_assembly_teacher_template}

## Briefing

Students design}} and assemble a complex multi-part}} object with tight tolerances. This project emphasizes assembly sequencing, tolerance stack-up, and quality}} verification in a constrained context.

Key Learning: Tolerance stack-up; assembly sequence planning; quality}} assurance for complex assemblies.

Real-world Connection: Complex assemblies (engines, electronics, medical devices) require careful tolerance management and assembly documentation.

## Constraints
- Minimum 5 distinct printed parts
- Assembly must require specific}} sequence (not arbitrary)
- Design}} must demonstrate tolerance thinking
- Assembly instructions must be clear and complete

## Functional Requirements
- All parts print}} successfully and function together
- Assembly sequence is documented and logical
- Tolerances managed to ensure reliable assembly
- Design}} shows evidence of iteration and testing

## Deliverables
- `.scad` with multi-part}} assembly
- Completed documentation template
- Assembly sequence diagram or written procedure
- Tolerance analysis for critical interfaces
- Photos of assembly steps and final product
- Reflection on assembly challenges

## Rubric

### Category 1: Problem & Solution (0-3)
Assembly completes successfully; parts function together.

### Category 2: Design}} & Code Quality (0-3)
Code is well-organized. Design}} shows tolerance awareness.

### Category 3: Documentation (0-3)
Assembly instructions clear. Tolerance analysis complete.

## Assessment Notes

- Strong submissions: Show clear assembly sequence, tolerance management at interfaces, and rigorous testing
- Reinforce: Tolerance stack-up concepts; assembly documentation importance
- Extension: Cost analysis; manufacturability review
