## Detailed Material Properties

### PLA (Polylactic Acid)
Characteristics:
- Biodegradable (under industrial conditions)
- Easy to print, beginner-friendly
- Available in many colors and finishes
- Brittle if too thin

Best Uses:
- Decorative objects
- Prototypes and tests
- Educational models
- Low-stress parts

Tips:
- Print without bed heat if possible
- Cooling fan helps quality
- Sensitive to moisture (dry storage)
- Avoid direct sunlight (UV degrades color)

### PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol)
Characteristics:
- Strong and durable
- Good temperature resistance
- Less brittle than PLA
- Slightly harder to print than PLA

Best Uses:
- Functional parts
- Outdoor objects
- Mechanical components
- Items requiring durability

Tips:
- Requires higher bed temperature
- Reduced cooling fan on first layers
- Slightly oozes while printing
- Better layer adhesion than PLA

### ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)
Characteristics:
- Very strong and durable
- Heat resistant
- Can be sanded and post-processed
- Warping issues common

Best Uses:
- High-stress parts
- Mechanical applications
- Parts needing heat resistance
- Projects requiring sanding/finishing

Tips:
- Use heated bed to prevent warping
- Enclose printer if possible
- Needs adequate ventilation (fumes)
- Print at slower speeds
- Avoid abrupt temperature changes

### TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane)
Characteristics:
- Flexible and rubber-like
- High durability
- Can stretch without breaking
- Difficult to print

Best Uses:
- Flexible parts
- Cushioning/dampening
- Phone cases
- Gaskets and seals

Tips:
- Print very slowly (10-30 mm/s)
- Use flexible nozzle or reduce pressure
- Direct drive extruder works better
- Requires patience and calibration

## Nozzle & Bed Temperature Guide

### Temperature Selection
- Too Low: Poor layer adhesion, weak prints, under-extrusion
- Too High: Filament degrades, nozzle stringing, oozing
- Optimal Range: Start middle of range, adjust by 5-10C

### First Layer Critical
- Use bed temperature at high end of range
- Reduce nozzle temperature by 5-10C for subsequent layers
- Slow down first layer speed to 50% of normal

### Print Speed vs. Temperature
| Temperature Range | Print Speed  | Quality  | Support Needed |
|-------------------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| Low               | 40-50 mm/s   | Moderate | Usually        |
| Medium            | 50-70 mm/s   | High     | Usually        |
| High              | 70-100+ mm/s | Lower    | Maybe          |

## Post-Processing Properties

### Strength After Printing

Structural Integrity Timeline:
- 0-24 hours: 70-80% of final strength
- 24-48 hours: 90-95% of final strength
- 48-72 hours: 99-100% of final strength
- 7+ days: Maximum strength (some materials still hardening)

Note: Allow adequate cooling before stress-testing parts

### Chemical Resistance

| Material | Water    | Alcohol  | Acetone   | Oils     | Acids    |
|----------|----------|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| PLA      | Low      | Low      | Dissolves | Low      | Low      |
| PETG     | High     | Moderate | Moderate  | High     | Moderate |
| ABS      | High     | Moderate | Dissolves | High     | Moderate |
| TPU      | Moderate | Low      | Low       | Moderate | Low      |

Acetone Notes: Can be used to smooth ABS and PETG (vapor or liquid)

## Environmental Factors

### Humidity Effects
- PLA: Absorbs moisture (store in dry container with desiccant)
- PETG: Moderate moisture absorption
- ABS: Low moisture absorption
- TPU: Low moisture absorption

Storage Conditions:
- Temperature: 15-25C
- Humidity: 30-50% relative humidity
- Away from direct sunlight
- In sealed container with desiccant packets

### Temperature Resistance (After Printing)

| Material | Safe to ~C | Softens at ~C | Notes                        |
|----------|------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| PLA      | 50-60      | 60-70         | Not suitable for hot items   |
| PETG     | 80-100     | 100-110       | Can handle warm environments |
| ABS      | 90-110     | 110-120       | Good heat resistance         |
| TPU      | 60-80      | 80-100        | Limited heat resistance      |

## Cost & Availability

### Material Cost per Print (for typical small project)
