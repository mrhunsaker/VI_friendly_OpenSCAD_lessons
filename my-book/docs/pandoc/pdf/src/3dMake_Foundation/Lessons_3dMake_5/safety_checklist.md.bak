# Safety Checklist for 3D Printing {#3dmake_foundation_lessons_3dmake_5-safety_checklist}

Complete this checklist before each printing session to maintain a safe workspace.

## Pre-Print Setup

- [ ] Work Area Clear
  - Clear desk/table of unnecessary items
  - Remove tripping hazards around printer
  - Ensure adequate ventilation around the printer

- [ ] Printer Inspection
  - Check nozzle is clean (no old filament residue)
  - Verify build plate is level
  - Confirm heated bed temperature sensor attached
  - Check all cables are secure and not frayed

- [ ] Filament Preparation
  - Filament spool rotates freely (no binding)
  - Filament path clear of obstructions
  - Extruder drive gear clean (not clogged with plastic)
  - New filament loaded correctly

- [ ] Environmental Conditions
  - Room temperature adequate (18-25C ideal)
  - No direct drafts from windows/AC on printer
  - Humidity levels reasonable (not extremely dry)
  - Adequate lighting to see printer clearly

## During Print

- [ ] First Layer Monitoring
  - Watch first 2-3 layers closely
  - Check bed adhesion (not too loose or tight)
  - Confirm nozzle temperature stable
  - Monitor for any unusual sounds

- [ ] Regular Checks
  - Check print every 15-30 minutes initially
  - Verify filament is feeding smoothly
  - Listen for grinding or skipping noises
  - Watch for layer shifting or warping

- [ ] Temperature Stability
  - Heated bed maintains consistent temperature
  - Nozzle temperature doesn't fluctuate
  - No thermal runaway warnings

## Safety Alerts

- [ ] STOP Print Immediately If
  - Nozzle jams or extrudes unevenly
  - Filament completely stops feeding
  - Burning smell detected
  - Visible layer shifting
  - Extruder grinding or skipping sounds
  - Any unusual smells (especially chemical/burning)
  - Power indicators show failure

## Post-Print

- [ ] Cool Down Period
  - Allow heated bed to cool naturally (10-15 min)
  - Keep hands clear until nozzle cools
  - Verify printer is idle before touching

- [ ] Print Removal
  - Use proper tools (spatula/scraper)
  - Remove print when bed fully cooled
  - Inspect print for defects or sharp edges
  - Sand sharp edges if necessary

- [ ] Equipment Cleaning
  - Wipe nozzle with brass wire when cooled
  - Remove any plastic debris from build plate
  - Check extruder for filament residue
  - Clean any visible dust from electronics

- [ ] Workspace Cleanup
  - Return tools to proper storage
  - Dispose of support material safely
  - Tidy workspace and verify clear pathways
  - Store filament properly in dry location

## Hazard Awareness

Hot Surfaces:
- Nozzle reaches 200-250C
- Bed reaches 60-100C
- Allow adequate cooling time before touching

Filament Hazards:
- Tangled filament can jam printer
- Always keep filament spool free-spinning
- Check for knots or kinks before printing

Electrical Safety:
- Never operate with wet hands
- Keep liquids away from printer
- Unplug before major maintenance
- Verify power supply is grounded

Material Hazards:
- Some filaments emit fumes when heated
- Ensure adequate ventilation
- Use HEPA filter if printing indoors
- Dispose of failed prints properly

## Emergency Contacts

- Printer Fire: Unplug immediately, use dry chemical extinguisher (NOT water)
- Burns: Rinse with cool water for 15+ minutes
- Inhalation Issues: Move to fresh air, seek medical attention if symptoms persist
