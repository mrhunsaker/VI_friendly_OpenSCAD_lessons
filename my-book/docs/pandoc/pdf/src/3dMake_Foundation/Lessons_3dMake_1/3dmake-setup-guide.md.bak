# 3dMake Setup & Workflow {#3dmake_foundation_lessons_3dmake_1-3dmake-setup-guide}

This guide walks you through installing 3dMake, creating projects, and managing your workflow efficiently.

## Installing 3dMake

### Prerequisites

Before installing 3dMake, ensure you have:

- Windows or Linux operating system (macOS is not currently supported)
- Terminal or PowerShell access
- Internet connection to download 3dMake
- At least 100 MB of free disk space

### Platform Support

Supported:

- Windows (32-bit and 64-bit)
- Linux (x86-64 architecture)

Not Supported:

- macOS - Currently no macOS version is available

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### Step 1: Download 3dMake for Your Operating System

Visit the 3dMake releases page and download the appropriate version:

Windows:

1. Go to [3dMake Windows Download](https://github.com/tdeck/3dmake/releases/latest/download/3dmakewindows.zip)
2. This downloads `3dmakewindows.zip` to your computer
3. Right-click the file and select "Extract All..." (or use your preferred extraction tool)
4. Remember where you extracted it (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\3dmake` or `C:\Program Files\3dmake`)

Linux:

1. Go to [3dMake Linux Download](https://github.com/tdeck/3dmake/releases/latest/download/3dmakelinux.tar.gz)
2. This downloads `3dmakelinux.tar.gz` to your computer
3. Extract it using: `tar -xzf 3dmakelinux.tar.gz`
4. Remember where you extracted it (e.g., `~/3dmake` or `/opt/3dmake`)

#### Step 2: Open Your Terminal

Windows:

- Press `Win + X` and select "Windows PowerShell" or "Terminal"
- For screen reader users: Use `Alt + F2` and type `powershell` if needed

Linux:

- Open your terminal application (Terminal, Konsole, GNOME Terminal, etc.)

#### Step 3: Navigate to 3dMake Directory

Navigate to where you extracted 3dMake:

Windows:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\YourName\3dmake
```

Linux:

```bash
cd ~/3dmake
```

For screen reader users: Use `pwd` (print working directory) to confirm your location.

#### Step 4: Run the Setup Command

From inside the 3dMake directory, run:

Windows:

```powershell
.\3dm setup
```

Linux:

```bash
./3dm setup
```

Follow the prompts to configure:

- Your default printer profile (e.g., Prusa MK4, Bambu Lab)
- OctoPrint connection (if you use OctoPrint)
- AI integration (optional - for model descriptions)
- Preferred text editor

#### Step 5: Complete Installation

After setup finishes, 3dMake will be available from any directory. You can now use the `3dm` command from your terminal.

Do not delete the original 3dMake directory where you extracted the files, as 3dMake needs to reference it.

#### Step 6: Verify Installation

```bash
3dm --version
```

You should see the installed version number. If you see an error, verify:

- You're in the 3dMake directory
- The extraction completed successfully
- Your terminal has access to the extracted files

#### Step 7: Get Help

```bash
3dm help
```

This displays all available 3dMake commands.

## Creating and Managing Projects

### What Is a 3dMake Project?

A 3dMake project is a folder structure that organizes:

- src/ folder - contains your OpenSCAD (.scad) files
- build/ folder - stores outputs that 3dMake generates (STL files, sliced GCODE, etc.)
- 3dmake.toml file - project configuration and settings
- README.md - project documentation

### Creating Your First Project

#### Step 1: Choose or Create a Project Directory

Decide where you want your project. Examples:

Windows:

```powershell
C:\Users\YourName\Documents\3d-projects\
C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\MyProject\
```

Linux:

```bash
~/3d-projects/
~/Documents/3d-projects/
```

Create the directory if it doesn't exist:

Windows:

```powershell
mkdir C:\Users\YourName\Documents\3d-projects\FirstProject
```

Linux:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/3d-projects/FirstProject
```

#### Step 2: Navigate Into Your Project Directory

Windows:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents\3d-projects\FirstProject
```

Linux:

```bash
cd ~/3d-projects/FirstProject
```

For screen reader users: Use `pwd` (print working directory) to confirm you're in the right folder.

#### Step 3: Initialize a 3dMake Project

```bash
3dm new
```

This creates the project structure:

```powershell
FirstProject/
+------ src/              (stores your .scad files)
+------ build/            (stores generated files: STL, GCODE, etc.)
+------ 3dmake.toml       (project configuration)
+------ README.md         (project documentation)
```

The `src/main.scad` file is created as a starting template.

#### Step 4: Verify Project Creation

Windows:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Force
```

Linux:

```bash
ls -la
```

You should see the `src/`, `build/`, `3dmake.toml`, and `README.md` files listed.

## Working With Your Project

### Creating OpenSCAD Models

#### Step 1: Create or Edit OpenSCAD Files

The main model file is `src/main.scad`. You can edit it directly using 3dMake:

```bash
3dm edit-model
```

This opens `src/main.scad` in your configured text editor.

To edit a different model (if you create additional .scad files):

```bash
3dm edit-model -m mymodel
```

This opens `src/mymodel.scad`.

Manual File Creation:

You can also create `.scad` files directly in the `src/` folder using your preferred text editor:

- Visual Studio Code
- Notepad++ (Windows)
- Gedit (Linux)
- Nano or Vim (terminal-based)

#### Step 2: Building Your Model

Before exporting, build the model from your OpenSCAD code:

```bash
3dm build
```

This converts your OpenSCAD code into a 3D mesh (geometry). The output is `build/main.stl`.

For a different model:

```bash
3dm build -m mymodel
```

This creates `build/mymodel.stl`.

#### Step 3: Viewing Model Information

To see statistics about your model:

```bash
3dm info
```

Output includes:

- Bounding box - dimensions (X, Y, Z in millimeters)
- Volume - cubic millimeters of material
- Face count - total triangles in the mesh
- Manifold status - whether model is watertight (printable)

Example output:

```plaintext
Volume: 1234.56 mm
Bounding Box: 50.0 x 40.0 x 30.0 mm
Faces: 2048
Manifold: Yes 
```

#### Step 4: Previewing Your Model

3dMake can create flat "tactile previews" of your model (fast-printing 2D silhouettes):

```bash
3dm preview slice
```

This generates a preview STL and slices it (ready to print in minutes).

To print the preview directly:

```bash
3dm preview print
```

Available preview types:

- `3sil` - Three silhouettes (front, left, top) - default
- `frontsil` - Front-facing silhouette only
- `topsil` - Top-down silhouette only

Change preview type:

```bash
3dm preview -v topsil print
```

#### Step 5: Slicing and Preparing for Print

To slice your model (convert STL to GCODE for your printer):

```bash
3dm build slice
```

This creates both:

- `build/main.stl` - the 3D model
- `build/main.gcode` - sliced for your printer

#### Step 6: Printing Directly from 3dMake

If your printer is connected via OctoPrint or Bambu Labs (LAN mode):

```bash
3dm build slice print
```

This builds, slices, and sends directly to your printer in one command.

Or simply:

```bash
3dm build print
```

(The `print` command automatically includes slicing)

## Managing Multiple Projects

### Switching Between Projects

#### Method 1: Navigate via Terminal

```bash
# Leave current project
cd ..

# Enter a different project
cd ../SecondProject
pwd  # Verify you're in the right place
```

For screen reader users, always use `pwd` after navigating to confirm your location.

#### Method 2: Create a Projects Directory Structure

Create a central folder for all projects:

```plaintext
3d-projects/
+------ FirstProject/
|   +------ src/
|   +------ build/
|   +------ 3dmake.toml
+------ SecondProject/
|   +------ src/
|   +------ build/
|   +------ 3dmake.toml
+------ README.md (project index)
```

#### Method 3: Use a Project Index

Create a `README.md` in your `3d-projects/` folder to track all projects:

```markdown
# My 3D Projects

## Project List

1. FirstProject - My initial test models
   - Location: `./FirstProject/src/`
   - Status: In progress
   - Latest model: `main.scad`

2. SecondProject - Parametric keychain designs
   - Location: `./SecondProject/src/`
   - Status: Complete
   - Latest model: `keychain.scad`

3. ThirdProject - Functional brackets for printing
   - Location: `./ThirdProject/src/`
   - Status: In progress
   - Latest model: `bracketassembly.scad`
```

### Building from All Projects

To build models from all projects:

Windows:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Directory | ForEach-Object {
    cd $.FullName
    3dm build
    cd ..
}
```

Linux/Bash:

```bash
for project in */; do
    cd "$project"
    3dm build
    cd ..
done
```

## Workflow Best Practices

### File Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive names for your `.scad` files:

Good:

- `cube5cm.scad`
- `parametricboxv2.scad`
- `bracketformotor.scad`
- `main.scad` (default project model)

Avoid:

- `test.scad`
- `model1.scad`
- `finalfinalFINAL.scad`

### Understanding TOML Configuration Files

What is TOML?

TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) is a human-readable configuration file format. It's designed to be simple and clear, making it easy to read and edit in any text editor.

Basic TOML Formatting Rules:

1. Key-value pairs - Each setting has a name and value separated by an equals sign:

   ```toml
   projectname = "My Project"
   ```

2. Strings use quotes - Text values must be wrapped in double quotes:

   ```toml
   editor = "code"
   printerprofile = "prusaMK4"
   ```

3. Numbers don't need quotes - Numeric values stand alone:

   ```toml
   scale = 1.05
   copies = 3
   ```

4. Boolean values are true or false - Lowercase, no quotes:

   ```toml
   autostartprints = true
   editinbackground = false
   ```

5. Arrays use square brackets - Lists of values separated by commas:

   ```toml
   overlays = ["supports", "PETG"]
   libraries = ["bosl", "braille-chars"]
   ```

6. One setting per line - Each configuration on its own line
7. Comments start with # - Use for notes (not processed):

   ```toml
   # This is my default printer
   printerprofile = "prusaMK4"
   ```

How 3dMake Uses TOML:

3dMake has two TOML configuration files:

- Global config (`defaults.toml`) - Settings for all your projects (run `3dm edit-global-config` to edit)
- Project config (`3dmake.toml`) - Settings specific to one project (located in your project root)

Project settings override global settings. For example, if your global config says `printerprofile = "prusaMK4"` but your project's `3dmake.toml` says `printerprofile = "bambu"`, the project setting wins.

### Project Configuration (3dmake.toml)

The `3dmake.toml` file in your project root contains project-specific settings:

```toml
projectname = "My Project"
modelname = "main"
printerprofile = "prusaMK4"
overlays = []
editor = "code"
```

Edit your project configuration:

```bash
3dm edit-global-config
```

This opens your configuration file in your text editor.

### Version Control (Optional)

If you're using Git, add a `.gitignore` to avoid committing large build files:

Create `.gitignore` in your project root:

```plaintext
build/
*.stl
*.gcode
*.png
.DSStore
pycache/
```

Then initialize Git:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
```

### Backup Strategy

Regularly backup your `src/` folder:

Windows:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Path "src" -Destination "backups/src$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyy-MM-dd')" -Recurse
```

Linux:

```bash
cp -r src backups/src$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

### Documentation

Keep a `src/README.md` describing each model:

```markdown
# Models in This Project

## main.scad
- Purpose: Primary design for this project
- Parameters: width, height, depth
- Last modified: 2026-02-20
- Notes: Standard model for printing

## alternate.scad
- Purpose: Alternative design variant
- Parameters: width, height, depth, wallthickness
- Last modified: 2026-02-15
- Notes: Experimental version with snap-fit features
```

### Configuring Your Text Editor

By default, 3dMake uses:

- Windows: Notepad
- Linux: Nano (or your EDITOR environment variable)

To use a different editor, edit your global configuration:

```bash
3dm edit-global-config
```

Add or modify the `editor` line. Examples:

Windows (Visual Studio Code):

```toml
editor = "code"
```

Windows (Notepad++):

```toml
editor = '''C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\notepad++.exe'''
```

Linux (Visual Studio Code):

```toml
editor = "code"
```

Linux (Gedit):

```toml
editor = "gedit"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "3dm command not found"

Cause: 3dMake isn't in your PATH or you haven't completed setup.

Solution:

1. Verify you extracted 3dMake and completed `3dm setup`
2. Restart your terminal completely (close and reopen)
3. Check that you're not inside the 3dMake directory when running commands
4. On Linux, ensure you're using `./3dm` if 3dMake isn't in your PATH yet

#### "No such file or directory: src/main.scad"

Cause: You're not in a valid 3dMake project directory.

Solution:

Verify you're in the project directory:

```bash
pwd
ls -la
```

You should see `src/`, `build/`, and `3dmake.toml` files. If not, run:

```bash
3dm new
```

#### "OpenSCAD error: syntax error at line 5"

Cause: Your `.scad` file has incorrect OpenSCAD syntax.

Solution:

1. Open your model file: `3dm edit-model`
2. Check the line number mentioned in the error
3. Verify correct OpenSCAD syntax (matching parentheses, semicolons, etc.)
4. Save and try building again: `3dm build`

#### "Model won't render or build"

Checklist:

- [ ] File is saved with `.scad` extension
- [ ] File is in the `src/` folder
- [ ] File has valid OpenSCAD syntax
- [ ] Build output has a specific error message (check line number)

Debug mode:

```bash
3dm build --debug
```

This provides more detailed error messages.

#### Screen reader isn't reading 3dMake output clearly

Solution: Use the `--debug` flag for more verbose output:

```bash
3dm build --debug
```

This logs each step, making it easier for screen readers to follow.

#### "Permission denied" error (Linux)

Cause: 3dMake executable doesn't have run permissions.

Solution:

```bash
chmod +x 3dm
./3dm setup
```

#### Cannot connect to printer

Cause: OctoPrint or Bambu printer settings not configured correctly.

Solution:

1. Verify printer is running and connected to network
2. Edit configuration: `3dm edit-global-config`
3. Check these settings:
   - `octoprinthost` - correct IP/URL
   - `octoprintkey` - valid API key
   - `printmode` - set to "octoprint" or "bambulan"
4. Test connection: `3dm build print` (without actually printing first)

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with basic projects:

1. Learn parametric design - Make reusable models with variables
2. Explore modules - Organize code into reusable functions
3. Add libraries - Use pre-built OpenSCAD libraries (BOSL, etc.)
4. Optimize workflows - Chain commands (`3dm build slice print`)
5. Automate models - Use loops and conditionals in OpenSCAD
6. Collaborate - Use Git to share projects with others
