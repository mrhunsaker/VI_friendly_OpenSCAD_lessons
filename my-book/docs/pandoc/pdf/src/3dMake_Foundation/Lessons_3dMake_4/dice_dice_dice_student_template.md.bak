- Description: Design parametric 3D-printed dice and test for fairness through statistical analysis.

## Design Concept

- Dice specifications (size, material, infill):
- How will you ensure uniform weight distribution?
- What design details will your dice include (pips, patterns)?

## Design Specifications

| Parameter              | Value |
|------------------------|-------|
| Die size               |       |
| Infill %               |       |
| Material               |       |
| Pip depth              |       |
| Pit/pip count per face |       |

## Fairness Testing

### Test Setup
- How many rolls will you conduct? (minimum 100)
- Rolling surface and method:
- Date/time of testing:

### Roll Results

| Face | Frequency (out of _ rolls) | Percentage | Expected % |
|------|----------------------------|------------|------------|
| 1    |                            |            | 16.67%     |
| 2    |                            |            | 16.67%     |
| 3    |                            |            | 16.67%     |
| 4    |                            |            | 16.67%     |
| 5    |                            |            | 16.67%     |
| 6    |                            |            | 16.67%     |

### Statistical Analysis

- Calculate chi-squared value or deviation from expected:
- Is the die fair (within statistical tolerance)?
- What face appears most/least frequently?

## Reflections

- Were you surprised by the results?
- What design factors influenced fairness?
- How would you improve the dice design?
- What did you learn about manufacturing precision?
