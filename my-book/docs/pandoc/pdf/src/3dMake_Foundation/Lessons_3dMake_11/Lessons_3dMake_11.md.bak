# Lesson 11: Stakeholder-Centric Design and the Beaded Jewelry Project {#3dmake_foundation_lessons_3dmake_11-lessons_3dmake_11}

Estimated time: 90-120 minutes | Level: Advanced

Learning Objectives

- Conduct stakeholder interviews to identify needs, wants, and constraints[^1]
- Extract functional requirements from interview data[^1]
- Design a product that meets explicit requirements (not assumptions)[^2]
- Iterate design based on stakeholder feedback[^2]
- Document design decisions for reproducibility and accessibility[^3]

Materials

- Interview worksheet (provided below)
- Notebook/laptop for notes
- Access to stakeholder (or use provided scenario)
- 3dMake project scaffold
- Calipers for measurement
- Reference: [master-rubric.md](master-rubric.md) for design documentation standards

Extension Project: Complete [Beaded_Jewelry_Unit](beaded-jewelry.md) to apply stakeholder-centric design principles in a real project context.

## Why This Matters: The Design Thinking Process

Most design failures start before CAD. They happen because:

- Assumption Problem: Designer assumes what users need without asking
- Specification Problem: Unclear requirements lead to wasted iterations
- Accessibility Problem: Features designed without considering all users

This lesson flips the process: Listen First, Design Second [^1].

### The Design Thinking Pipeline

```plaintext
1. Empathize (Listen to stakeholder)
   v
2. Define (Extract functional requirements)
   v
3. Ideate (Sketch/prototype solutions)
   v
4. Prototype (Build in CAD)
   v
5. Test (Get feedback)
   v
6. Iterate (Refine based on feedback)
```

## Stakeholder Interviews (20-30 minutes)

### What is a Stakeholder?

A stakeholder is anyone who will use, interact with, or be affected by your design. Examples:

- End User: Person who directly uses the product
- Maintenance Person: Someone who repairs/replaces parts
- Budget Holder: Person responsible for cost
- Safety Officer: Person ensuring regulatory compliance

### Open-Ended Interview Questions

Good interview questions:

- [YES] Start with "What," "How," "Why"
- [YES] Don't suggest answers
- [YES] Follow up with "Tell me more..."
- [YES] Listen for numbers, specific stories, pain points

Bad interview questions:

- [NO] "Do you like...?" (Yes/No - no detail)
- [NO] "Would you prefer A or B?" (Forced choice)
- [NO] "Don't you think...?" (Leading question)

### Sample Interview Script (Beaded Jewelry)

You're designing a custom beaded bracelet holder. Here's how to interview a stakeholder:

```plaintext
Opening:
"Hi [name], I'm designing a way to store and display beaded 
bracelets. I'd love to understand how YOU currently use bracelets 
so I can design something that works for you. Is now a good time?"
Question 1: "Tell me about your current bracelet collection. 
How many do you have? What are they made of?"
Question 2: "How do you currently store or display them? 
What works well? What's frustrating?"
Question 3: "If you could design the perfect bracelet holder, 
what would it look like? What would it do?"
Question 4: "Are there any constraints I should know about? 
(Size of your space, colors, budget, etc.)"
Question 5: "Who else might use this? How would their needs 
differ from yours?"
Closing:
"Thank you for your time. I'll design based on what you've told me 
and come back with a prototype for feedback."
```

### Step-by-Step Interview Task

Duration: 15 minutes total

1. Prepare (5 min):
   - Choose your stakeholder or use the scenario below
   - Write 4-6 questions using the template above
   - Explain the project and get permission to take notes

2. Conduct (10 min):
   - Ask your prepared questions
   - Write down specific details (numbers, names, quotes)
   - Listen more than you talk
   - Ask "Why?" when you hear interesting responses

3. Document (Immediately after):
   - Write a 2-3 sentence summary
   - Extract 3-5 key needs/constraints
   - Identify any questions that still need answers

### Scenario: If You Don't Have a Real Stakeholder

Scenario: Meet Sarah, a jewelry enthusiast

Sarah has 15+ beaded bracelets but they're tangled in a drawer. She wants to:

- Display them where she can see them
- Keep them organized by color/style
- Protect them from tangling
- Fit in a small space on her desk

Constraints:

- Budget: $15 materials cost
- Space: 6" x 6" footprint maximum
- Aesthetic: Minimalist, natural wood preferred
- Timeline: Needs it within 2 weeks

## Extract Functional Requirements (20-30 minutes)

### From Interview to Requirements

A functional requirement is specific, measurable, and testable:

| Interview Data                 | [NO] Bad Requirement | [YES] Good Requirement                      |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| "I have 15 bracelets"          | Lots of storage      | Hold 15-20 bracelets without damage         |
| "They're tangled in my drawer" | Keep organized       | Vertical hanging system to prevent tangling |
| "I want to see them"           | Display feature      | Visible from above (no lid)                 |
| "Minimalist, natural wood"     | Nice looking         | Wood construction,  2 colors, clean lines   |

### Functional Requirements Template

For your beaded jewelry holder, extract 5-8 requirements:

```
Functional Requirements:
1. Capacity: Hold  bracelets
2. Organization: Arrange by  (color/size/style)
3. Protection: Prevent  (tangling/damage)
4. Display: Visible from  (above/front/sides)
5. Dimensions:  mm wide,  mm deep,  mm tall
6. Material:  (wood/plastic/metal)
7. Accessibility:  (non-visual inspection method)
8. Durability: Withstand  (weight/use/time)
```

### Measurable Acceptance Criteria

For each requirement, define how you'll TEST it:

| Requirement       | Measurement Method                                           |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hold 15 bracelets | Count actual bracelets loaded; verify no deformation         |
| Prevent tangling  | Manual inspection: no twisting/knotting after 1 week storage |
| Dimensions        | Measure with calipers; compare to design parameters          |
| Wood material     | Visual inspection; material weight check                     |
| Withstand weight  | Load test: 2kg weight for 1 hour; check for deformation      |

## Design the Bracelet Holder (30-40 minutes)

### Design Strategy

Based on functional requirements, create a parametric SCAD model:

```openscad
// Parametric Beaded Bracelet Holder
// Designed for: [Stakeholder name]
// Requirements: [List 3-5 key requirements]
// === PARAMETERS (from stakeholder requirements) ===
holderwidth = 150;      // mm - width for 15+ bracelets
holderdepth = 80;       // mm - depth for stability
holderheight = 120;     // mm - height for display
numpegs = 16;           // Number of hanging pegs
pegdiameter = 6;        // mm - bracelet hang diameter
pegspacing = holderwidth / (numpegs + 1);
// === DESIGN ===
module base() {
  // Wooden-look base plate
  cube([holderwidth, holderdepth, 10]);
}
module backwall() {
  // Back support for stability
  translate([0, 0, 10])
    cube([holderwidth, 5, holderheight]);
}
module hangingpegs() {
  // Pegs for bracelets to hang
  for (i = [1 : numpegs]) {
    xpos = pegspacing * i;
    translate([xpos, holderdepth/2, holderheight - 20])
      cylinder(r=pegdiameter/2, h=30, $fn=16);
  }
}
module braceletholder() {
  // Combine all components
  union() {
    base();
    backwall();
    hangingpegs();
  }
}
// Main
braceletholder();
```

### Customization Based on Stakeholder Feedback

Before printing, modify parameters:

```
Interview revealed:
- "15 bracelets is about right"
- "I like minimal spacing"
- "Natural wood color"
- "Small desk space - maybe 5 inches wide?"

Updated parameters:
numpegs = 15;           // Exact count for their collection
holderwidth = 127;      // 5 inches in mm
pegspacing = holderwidth / (numpegs + 1);
```

### Testing Non-Visually

```bash
# Describe the model to verify it matches requirements
3dm describe src/main.scad

# Expected output should mention:
# - 15 hanging pegs arranged horizontally
# - Base plate for stability
# - Back wall for support
# - Dimensions approximately 127mm x 80mm x 120mm

# Generate preview for tactile inspection
3dm preview src/main.scad
```

## Iterate Based on Feedback (20-30 minutes)

### Feedback Loop

After printing a test version:

1. Measure physical parts:

   ```bash
   # Use calipers to verify
   - Actual width:  mm (design: 127mm)
   - Actual peg diameter:  mm (design: 6mm)
   - Actual spacing:  mm
   ```

2. Test with actual bracelets:
   - Can 15 bracelets actually hang?
   - Do they tangle?
   - Do pegs support the weight?
   - Is it stable on the desk?

3. Document feedback:

   ```markdown
   Test Results:
   - [YES] Holds 15 bracelets comfortably
   -  Pegs slightly too thin (bracelets slip)
   - [YES] No tangling observed
   -  Wobbles slightly - needs wider base
   
   Adjustments for v2:
   - Increase pegdiameter: 6mm -> 8mm
   - Increase basedepth: 80mm -> 100mm
   ```

4. Iterate:

   ```openscad
   // Modified parameters for v2
   pegdiameter = 8;        // Thicker pegs (8mm instead of 6mm)
   holderdepth = 100;      // Wider base (100mm instead of 80mm)
   ```

5. Reprint and test:
   - Does v2 address the issues?
   - Any new problems?
   - Is it ready for final design?

### Accessible Iteration Tracking

Document all iterations in a spreadsheet or text file:

```plaintext
Version | Peg Size | Base Depth | Fits Bracelets | Stable | Notes
--------|----------|------------|----------------|--------|--------------------
v1      | 6mm      | 80mm       | [YES] (14/15)  |        | Wobbles, pegs thin
v2      | 8mm      | 100mm      | [YES] (15/15)  | [YES]  | Perfect fit, stable
v3      | 8mm      | 100mm      | [YES] (15/15)  | [YES]  | With wood stain
```
