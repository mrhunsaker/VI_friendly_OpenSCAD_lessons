This folder holds non-markdown assets (OpenSCAD files, images, PDFs, etc.)
that should be available for download from the generated mdBook site.

Guidelines:

- Place project files under subfolders - for example, `assets/3dMake_Foundation/`.
- Link from markdown with relative paths, e.g. `[Download SCAD](3dMake_Foundation/Lessons_3dMake_1/basic_project_scaffold.scad)`.
- Files in `src/assets` will be copied verbatim into the built `book/` output.
