# Lesson 2: Geometric Primitives and Constructive Solid Geometry {#assets_3dmake_foundation_lessons_3dmake_2-readme}

Estimated time: 60 minutes

## Folder Contents

This folder contains supporting materials for Lesson 2:

- Starter Code: Example snippets for primitives and CSG operations
- Extension Projects: Your_Second_Print and Bonus_Print for real-world application
- Reference Materials: OpenSCAD cheat sheet, slicer validation guides

## Learning Objectives

- Use OpenSCAD primitives: `cube()`, `sphere()`, `cylinder()`
- Apply CSG operators: `union`, `difference`, `intersection`
- Diagnose and fix common geometry issues
- Validate geometry in a slicer

## Key Materials

- [Lesson 2 Main Content](../../../3dMake_Foundation/Lessons_3dMake_2/Lessons_3dMake_2.md)
- [OpenSCAD Cheat Sheet](../../../3dMake_Foundation/Lessons_3dMake_2/openscad-cheat-sheet.md)
- [Appendix A: Comprehensive Slicing Guide](../../../3dMake_Foundation/Appendix_A_Comprehensive_Slicing_Guide.md)

## Extension Projects in This Folder

### Your_Second_Print

Purpose: Adapt existing models to meet real-world needs; practice iteration and documentation

Time: 4-8 hours (design, adapt, print, document)

Skills Developed:
- Model evaluation and adaptation
- Parametric modification
- Iterative design and testing
- Documentation and changelog practices

### Bonus_Print

Purpose: Scaling and simple modifications; multi-part printing and documentation

Time: 2-3 hours

Skills Developed:
- Model scaling and resizing
- Multi-part workflow
- Print organization and tracking

## Quick Start

1. Complete Lesson 2, referencing the OpenSCAD Cheat Sheet
2. Work through Your_Second_Print to practice model adaptation
3. Use Appendix A for slicer validation techniques
4. (Optional) Complete Bonus_Print for additional scaling practice
