# Snap-Fit Clip - Extension Project  {#3dmake_foundation_lessons_3dmake_8-snap_fit_clip}

Estimated time}}: 3-6 hours

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you}} will:
- Design}} flexible components that must bend without failing
- Conduct tolerance and material}} testing systematically
- Understand the relationship between}} geometry}}, material}} properties, and functional performance
- Document design}} iterations and trade-offs

## Objective
- Design}} a snap-fit clip with customizable clip thickness and spacing to determine optimal tolerances for your printer}} and material}}.

## Tasks
1. Design}} a parametric}} snap-fit test}} piece with adjustable clip thickness and spacing.
2. Print test}} pieces for three tolerance values (adjust clip geometry}} for each}} variant).
3. Test each}} clip for snap-fit behavior and document success/failure modes.
4. Refine dimensions based on testing results and create}} final clip design}}.

## Deliverable
- Source `.scad` file}} with parametric}} clip modules
- Test print}} results and tolerance documentation
- Final clip design}} with recommended print}} settings

## Starter files}}
- [starter.scad](../../assets/Extension_Projects/Snap_Fit_Clip/starter.scad) - minimal snap-fit test}} scaffold.

## Assessment Questions (Optional)
1. What clip thickness and spacing values resulted in a reliable snap-fit for your printer}}?
2. How did you}} balance flexibility (easy to snap/unsnap) with durability (no premature failure)?
3. What would you}} change in the design}} if this clip needed to work}} reliably 1,000+ times?
