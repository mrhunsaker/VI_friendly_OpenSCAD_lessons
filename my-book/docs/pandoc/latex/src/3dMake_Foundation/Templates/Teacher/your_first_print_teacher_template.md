# Your First Print - Teacher Template (Extension Project) {#3dmake_foundation_templates_teacher-your_first_print_teacher_template}

## Briefing

A foundational extension project where students select a ready-made 3D model from online repositories, configure slicer settings, and complete their first}} independent print}} job. This project builds confidence and establishes safe printing}} practices.

Key Learning: Printer safety; slicer configuration; print}} monitoring; dimensional verification.

Real-world Connection: Production environments rely on safe print}} setup and quality}} verification. This project establishes habits that transfer to any 3D printing}} context.

## Constraints
- Model}} must be  2 hours print}} time}}
- No or minimal support}} requirements recommended
- Student must document printer}} configuration and safety checks
- Student must compare printed dimensions to model specifications

## Functional Requirements
- Model}} selected and deemed appropriate for beginner
- Printer configured safely with classroom profile
- Print completes successfully with good adhesion
- Printed part}} is measured and deviations documented

## Deliverables
- Completed documentation template with:
  - Model}} selection rationale and printability assessment
  - Printer setup log (materials, temperature, settings)
  - Print monitoring observations (first}} 10 minutes, monitoring during print}})
  - Dimensional measurements and deviation analysis
  - Reflection on first}} print}} experience
  - Post-print}} analysis and troubleshooting notes
- Photograph of final print}}
- Slicer}} settings (screenshot or text}} export)

## Rubric

All projects are scored on a 0-9 scale across three equally weighted categories (3 points each}}):

| Category                | Points | What We Measure                                                                     |
|-------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Problem & Solution      | 0-3    | Did the student select an appropriate model? Did the print}} succeed?               |
| Design}} & Code Quality | 0-3    | Is documentation of printer}} setup thorough? Is print}} quality}} good?            |
| Documentation           | 0-3    | Is all documentation complete? Are measurements recorded? Is reflection thoughtful? |

| 1     | Model}} had some difficulties; print}} partially successful or required intervention.                                                 |
| 0     | Print failed or model was inappropriate.                                                                                              |

| 3     | Printer setup documented thoroughly. Safety checks evident. Print quality}} excellent. Photos provided. |
| 2     | Setup documented adequately. Print quality}} acceptable. Some documentation of settings.                |
| 1     | Minimal documentation of setup. Print quality}} has defects.                                            |
| 0     | Setup not documented or print}} failed to start.                                                        |

## Resubmission Policy

Students may resubmit to improve their score. Resubmissions must include:
1. A one}}-paragraph explanation of what was changed and why

The resubmission score replaces the original.

## Assessment Notes

- Strong submissions show careful model selection reasoning, thorough printer}} documentation, and specific}} observations about print}} behavior
- Watch for: Poor printer}} documentation, dismissive attitude toward safety checks, or generic reflections
- Reinforce: Safety first}}; documentation enables learning and troubleshooting
- Next Step: Extension problem suggestions include print}} quality}} analysis or variant material}} testing
