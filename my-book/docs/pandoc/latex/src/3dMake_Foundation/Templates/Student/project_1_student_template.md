# Project 1: Tactile Floor Markers - Student Documentation Template {#3dmake_foundation_templates_student-project_1_student_template}

- Description: Design a tactile floor marker that meets measurable accessibility requirements and tests tactile effectiveness through iteration.

## Ideas and Concept

### Project Framing
- What problem are you solving with this marker?
- Who is the end user, and what accessibility needs does this address?

### Functional Requirements (Define Five)

| Requirement | Acceptance Test (How will you measure success?) |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 1.          |                                                 |
| 2.          |                                                 |
| 3.          |                                                 |
| 4.          |                                                 |
| 5.          |                                                 |

### Design Approach
- What marker shapes or patterns will you test?
- Describe your planned OpenSCAD modules

## Measurements and Constraints

### Target Surface

- Surface material: _
- Surface dimensions: _ x _ mm
- Access constraints (e.g., edges, obstacles):

### Marker Dimensions

| Parameter                     | Value |
|-------------------------------|-------|
| Height                        |       |
| Width                         |       |
| Depth                         |       |
| Hole Diameter (if applicable) |       |

## Object Notes

### Prototype 1 Design

- Describe `bead_A` and `bead_B` modules
- What parameters do they accept?
- What was your design rationale for each shape?

### Prototype 1 Testing

- Tactile feedback: How well could a tester distinguish this marker tactilely?
- Adhesion: How well did it stay in place?
- Surface texture: Was it effective? Why or why not?

### Prototype 2 Iteration

- What did you change between Prototype 1 and 2?
- Why did you make this change?

| Parameter | Prototype 1 | Prototype 2 | Reason for Change |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
|           |             |             |                   |
|           |             |             |                   |

### Prototype 2 Testing

- Did the changes improve tactile recognition?
- How did Prototype 2 perform on your acceptance tests?

## Assembly / Installation / Use Notes

### Assembly Method
- How do you attach the marker to the floor/surface?
- What tools or adhesives are required?

### Installation Instructions
- Step-by-step procedure (written for someone using a screen reader)

### Maintenance
- How long will markers last?
- How would you replace a worn marker?

## Reflections

### What Went Well
- Which functional requirement was easiest to meet?
- What iteration surprised you or worked better than expected?

### What Didn't Go Well
- Which requirement was hardest to validate?
- What design challenge did you encounter?

### Accessibility Feedback
- Did you test with a user (or simulate non-visual testing)?
- What feedback would you incorporate in a third iteration?

### Next Steps
- If you could redesign, what would you change?
- How would you scale this to different surface types or locations?
