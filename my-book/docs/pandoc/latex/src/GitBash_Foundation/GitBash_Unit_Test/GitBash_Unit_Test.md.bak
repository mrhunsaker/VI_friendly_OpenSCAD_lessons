## Part C: Hands-On Tasks (10 tasks)

Complete each task and capture evidence (screenshots, output files, or command transcripts). Each task is worth 3 points.

### Tasks 1-5: File System and Navigation

1. Create a folder structure `~/Documents/GitBash_Assessment/Projects` using a single command. Capture the `ls -1` output showing the creation.

2. Create five files named `project_1.scad`, `project_2.scad`, `project_3.txt`, `notes_1.txt`, and `notes_2.txt` inside the `Projects` folder. Use wildcards to list only `.scad` files, then capture the output.

3. Copy the entire `Projects` folder to `Projects_Backup` using `cp -r`. Capture the `ls -1` output showing both folders exist.

4. Move (rename) `project_1.scad` to `project_1_final.scad`. Capture the `ls -1` output showing the renamed file.

5. Delete `notes_1.txt` and `notes_2.txt` using a single `rm` command with wildcards. Capture the final `ls -1` output.

### Tasks 6-10: Advanced Operations and Scripting

6. Create a file called `my_data.txt` with at least four lines using `echo` and `>>`. Then read it with `cat my_data.txt` and capture the output.

7. Use `grep` to search for a keyword (e.g., "project") in `my_data.txt` and pipe the results to `clip`. Paste the results into Notepad and capture a screenshot.

8. List all files in the `Projects` folder and redirect the output to `projects_list.txt`. Open it in Notepad and capture a screenshot of the file.

9. Create a temporary alias called `myls` that runs `ls -1`, test it, and capture the output. Then explain what would be required to make it persistent.

10. Run `man ls` (or `ls --help`) and redirect the output to `help_output.txt`. Open the file in Notepad and capture a screenshot showing at least the first page of help content.
