- Final product with documentation
- Stakeholder feedback and iteration log

## Interview & Requirements Templates

- `stakeholder_interview_template.md` - Guided interview questions
- `functional_requirements_template.md` - Converting interview data to requirements
- `design_specification_template.md` - Complete design documentation
- `feedback_collection_template.md` - Gathering and documenting stakeholder feedback

## Quick Start

1. Complete Lesson 11 on design thinking and stakeholder engagement
