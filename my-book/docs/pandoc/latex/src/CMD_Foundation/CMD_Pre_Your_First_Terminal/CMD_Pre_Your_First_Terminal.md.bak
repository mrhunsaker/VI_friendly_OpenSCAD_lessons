# CMD-Pre: Your First Terminal - Screen Reader Navigation Fundamentals {#cmd_foundation_cmd_pre_your_first_terminal-cmd_pre_your_first_terminal}

**Duration:** 1.5-2 hours (for screen reader users)  
**Prerequisites:** None — this is the starting point  
**Accessibility Note:** This lesson is designed specifically for screen reader users. Tips are provided for NVDA, JAWS, Windows Narrator, and Dolphin SuperNova.

## What is a Terminal?

A terminal (also called command line or Command Prompt) is a text-based interface where you type commands instead of clicking buttons. Think of it like sending written instructions to your computer instead of pointing and clicking.

**Why learn this?**

- Faster and more precise work, especially for 3D printing scripts and automation.
- Essential for using tools like OpenSCAD.
- Accessibility: command-line tools work reliably with screen readers — output is plain text.
- Simple automation without complex graphical interfaces.

## Opening Command Prompt for the First Time

### Method 1: Search (Easiest)

1. Press the **Windows key** alone.
2. Type: `cmd`
3. You will hear search results appear.
4. Press **Enter** to open the first result (Command Prompt).

### Method 2: Using the Run Dialog

1. Press **Windows key + R** (opens the Run dialog).
2. Type: `cmd`
3. Press **Enter**.

### Method 3: From the Start Menu

1. Press the **Windows key**.
2. Navigate to **Windows System** or **Windows Tools** (depending on your Windows version).
3. Open **Command Prompt**.

### First Connection: Understanding the Prompt

When Command Prompt opens, your screen reader will announce the window title and then the **prompt**. The prompt is where you type commands.

**What you will hear:**

```plaintext
C:\Users\YourName>
```

**What this means:**

- `C:\Users\YourName` = Your current location (the path).
- `>` = The prompt is ready for input.

Your cursor is right after the `>`. This is where you type.

---

## Your First Commands (Screen Reader Edition)

### Command 1: "Where Am I?" — `cd`

Running `cd` with no arguments shows your current directory.

**Type this and press Enter:**

```cmd
cd
```

**What you will hear:**
Your screen reader announces the current path, for example:

```plaintext
C:\Users\YourName
```

**Understanding paths:**

- A path shows your location in the file system, like a mailing address.
- Windows paths use backslashes: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents`
- Think of it as nested folders: `C:\` (the main drive) → `Users` → `YourName` → `Documents`

### Command 2: "What's Here?" — `dir`

**Type this and press Enter:**

```cmd
dir /B
```

**What you will hear:**
Your screen reader announces folder and file names, one per line. The `/B` flag gives a clean "bare" listing — names only, no dates or sizes — which is much easier to follow with a screen reader.

If you want more detail (sizes, dates), run `dir` without `/B`. But for navigation, `dir /B` is preferred.

### Command 3: "Go There" — `cd Documents`

**Type this and press Enter:**

```cmd
cd Documents
```

**What you will hear:**
The prompt changes to show your new location:

```plaintext
C:\Users\YourName\Documents>
```

**Practice navigation:**

1. Run `cd` to confirm you are in Documents.
2. Run `dir /B` to see what is there.
3. Go back up: `cd ..` (the `..` means "go up one level").
4. Run `cd` again to confirm.
5. Return to Documents: `cd Documents`

## Reading Screen Reader Output (Critical Skills)

### Dealing with Long Lists

When you run `dir` in a folder with many files, the list may be very long. Here is how to manage it:

**Solution 1: Save to a File**

```cmd
dir /B > list.txt
notepad.exe list.txt
```

This saves the listing to a file and opens it in Notepad, where you can read it calmly with your screen reader.

**Solution 2: Use Pause**

```cmd
dir /B | more
```

Shows output one page at a time. Press **Space** to go to the next page, **Q** to quit. Note: some screen readers read `more` output less reliably than a saved file — if this is difficult, use Solution 1.

### Tab Completion

Tab completion is one of the most powerful screen reader techniques in the terminal.

**How it works:**

1. Type the first few letters of a folder or file name.
2. Press **Tab**.
3. Command Prompt automatically completes the rest.

**Example:**

1. You are at `C:\Users\YourName>`
2. Type: `cd Doc`
3. Press **Tab**
4. Command Prompt completes it to: `cd Documents`
5. Press **Enter** to navigate there.

With a screen reader, when you press Tab the screen reader announces the completed command — much faster and more accurate than typing the whole thing.

## Creating and Viewing Files

### Create a Simple File

```cmd
echo Hello, Command Prompt! > hello.txt
```

- `echo` outputs text.
- `>` redirects it to a file called `hello.txt`.

### Read the File Back

```cmd
type hello.txt
```

Your screen reader announces the file contents.

### Open and Edit the File

```cmd
notepad.exe hello.txt
```

Opens the file in Notepad for comfortable editing with your screen reader.

## Common Issue: "I Can't Hear the Output"

This happens to everyone starting out. Here are the solutions:

1. **Make sure your screen reader was running before you opened Command Prompt.** If not, close Command Prompt, confirm your screen reader is running, then reopen it.
2. **Press End** to make sure your cursor is at the prompt.
3. **Redirect to a file**: `command > output.txt`, then `notepad.exe output.txt`. This always works with all screen readers.
4. **Use the screen reader's review commands** listed above to scan back through previous output.

## Practice Exercises

Complete these in order. Take your time.

### Exercise 1: Basic Navigation

1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Run `cd` and note your location.
3. Run `dir /B` and listen to the listing.
4. Type `cd Documents` and press Enter.
5. Run `cd` to confirm your new location.
6. Run `dir /B` in this new location.

**Goal:** You know where you are and what is around you.

### Exercise 2: Using Tab Completion

1. In your home directory, type `cd D` (just those two characters).
2. Press **Tab**.
3. Command Prompt should auto-complete to a folder starting with D.
4. Repeat with other folder names.
5. Try `cd Down` and Tab to `Downloads`.

**Goal:** Tab completion feels natural.

### Exercise 3: Creating and Viewing Files

1. Create a file: `echo Test content > test.txt`
2. View it: `type test.txt`
3. Create another: `echo Line 2 > another.txt`
4. List both: `dir /B *.txt`

**Goal:** You understand create, view, and list operations.

### Exercise 4: Going Up Levels

1. Navigate into several folders: `cd Documents`, then `cd folder1`, etc.
2. From inside, run `cd ..` multiple times to come back up.
3. After each `cd ..`, run `cd` to confirm your location.

**Goal:** You are comfortable with relative navigation using `..`

### Exercise 5: Redirecting Output

1. Create a listing: `dir /B > directorylist.txt`
2. Open it: `notepad.exe directorylist.txt`
3. Read it with your screen reader.
4. Close Notepad.

**Goal:** You can save long outputs to files for easier reading.

## Checkpoint Questions

After this lesson, you should be able to answer all ten with confidence:

1. What does `cd` do with no arguments?
2. What does `dir /B` do?
3. Why do we use `/B` with `dir`?
4. What is your current path right now?
5. How do you navigate to a new folder?
6. How do you go up one level?
7. What is the Tab key for?
8. What does `echo text > file.txt` do?
9. How do you read a file back in the terminal?
10. How do you stop a command that is running?

**Answer all 10 before moving to CMD-0.**

## Common Questions

**Q: Should I use Command Prompt or PowerShell?**  
A: Command Prompt is simpler and a good starting point. PowerShell is more powerful. Both work well with all four screen readers covered in this curriculum. Start with whichever your curriculum pathway specifies.

**Q: Why is my screen reader not reading the output?**  
A: This is common. Use `command > file.txt` to save output to a file, then open it with `notepad.exe file.txt` for reliable reading.

**Q: What if I type something wrong?**  
A: Press **Enter** and you will see an error message. Type the correct command on the next line. No harm done.

**Q: How do I get help with a command?**  
A: Type `help command-name` (for example, `help cd`). Or type `command /?` for built-in help (for example, `dir /?`).
