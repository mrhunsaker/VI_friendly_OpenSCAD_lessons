## Getting Started with Screen Readers {#getting-started}

### Which Screen Reader Should I Use?

NVDA, JAWS, Windows Narrator, and Dolphin SuperNova all work with the three shells covered in this curriculum. Here is a brief comparison:

| Feature              | NVDA                   | JAWS                   | Windows Narrator          | Dolphin SuperNova  |
|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| **Cost**             | Free (open-source)     | Commercial (paid)      | Free (built into Windows) | Commercial (paid)  |
| **Installation**     | Simple download        | Complex but thorough   | Already installed         | Standard installer |
| **Terminal Support** | Excellent (all shells) | Excellent (all shells) | Good (all shells)         | Good (all shells)  |
| **Learning Curve**   | Gentle                 | Steeper                | Minimal                   | Moderate           |
| **Customization**    | Good (add-ons)         | Extensive (scripts)    | Limited                   | Good               |

**Recommendation:** If you are new to screen readers, start with NVDA (free, well-documented, good community support) or Windows Narrator (already on your computer, no installation needed). JAWS and Dolphin SuperNova are excellent choices if you already own a license or your organization provides one.

### Before You Start

1. Make sure your screen reader is running **before** opening your terminal.
2. Open your terminal (PowerShell, CMD, or Git Bash) and let your screen reader read the title and prompt.
3. If you do not hear anything, press **Alt+Tab** to cycle windows and find your terminal.
4. Use your screen reader's review/virtual cursor to understand the layout.

## Windows Narrator-Specific Tips {#narrator-tips}

Windows Narrator is built into Windows 10 and Windows 11 at no extra cost. Enable it via **Settings → Accessibility → Narrator** or press **Windows+Ctrl+Enter**.

These tips work across all shells: PowerShell, CMD, and Git Bash.

### Key Commands for Terminals

| Command                       | What It Does                                     |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Narrator+D**                | Read current line                                |
| **Narrator+M**                | Read next line                                   |
| **Narrator+I**                | Read current item or focused element             |
| **Narrator+R**                | Read from cursor / read all from here            |
| **Narrator+Ctrl+R**           | Read page / read all                             |
| **Narrator+Left/Right Arrow** | Move to previous/next item                       |
| **Narrator+Up/Down Arrow**    | Move to previous/next line in scan mode          |
| **Narrator+Enter**            | Activate/interact with current item              |
| **Narrator+Space**            | Toggle Narrator scan mode (browse vs. type mode) |
| **Narrator+F1**               | Open Narrator help                               |
| **Windows+Ctrl+Enter**        | Start or stop Narrator                           |

> **Note on Narrator key:** The Narrator modifier is **CapsLock** or **Insert** by default. You can change this in **Settings → Accessibility → Narrator → Keyboard shortcuts**.

### Working with Terminals Using Narrator

Narrator works well in **focus mode** (the default when a terminal is active). In focus mode, arrow keys move through command history and output rather than triggering Narrator navigation.

**Tips:**
- After running a command, press **Narrator+D** to read the current line.
- Use **Narrator+R** to read all output from the current position.
- For long outputs, always redirect to a file: `command > output.txt`, then open in Notepad where Narrator's reading experience is more comfortable.
- In Windows Terminal, enable **"Accessible terminal"** mode in Windows Terminal settings for better Narrator integration.

### Narrator Settings for Terminals

1. Open **Settings → Accessibility → Narrator**.
2. Under **"Change what you hear when typing"**, enable **"Hear characters as you type"**.
3. Under **"Change what Narrator reads"**, enable **"Read hints for controls and buttons"**.
4. Set verbosity level to **3 or 4** for a good balance of detail.
5. Under **"Choose a Narrator voice"**, select a voice you find comfortable for extended use.

**Known limitation:** Narrator has fewer customization options than JAWS or NVDA for advanced terminal work. If you find Narrator insufficient for complex workflows, consider switching to NVDA (free) or JAWS.

## Dolphin SuperNova-Specific Tips {#dolphin-tips}

Dolphin SuperNova is a commercial screen reader (with optional magnification) available from [https://example.com](https://example.com)

These tips work across all shells: PowerShell, CMD, and Git Bash.

### Key Commands for Terminals

| Command                                | What It Does                             |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Caps Lock+Down Arrow** (or NumPad 2) | Read current line                        |
| **Caps Lock+Numpad 5**                 | Read current word                        |

| **Caps Lock+Numpad 4**                 | Read previous word                       |
| **Caps Lock+Numpad 8**                 | Read from cursor to top                  |
| **Caps Lock+Numpad 2**                 | Read from cursor to bottom               |
| **Caps Lock+Numpad Plus**              | Say all / read all from current position |
| **Caps Lock+L**                        | Re-read current line                     |
| **Caps Lock+Right Arrow**              | Read next character                      |
| **Caps Lock+Left Arrow**               | Read previous character                  |
| **Caps Lock+Page Down**                | Jump to end of document or screen        |
| **Caps Lock+Page Up**                  | Jump to start of document or screen      |

> **Note on Dolphin key:** Dolphin SuperNova typically uses **Caps Lock** as its modifier key (referred to as the "Dolphin key"). This can be changed in **SuperNova Control Panel → Keyboard**.

### Working with Terminals Using Dolphin SuperNova

1. Open SuperNova **before** opening your terminal application.
2. Dolphin SuperNova automatically tracks focus as you move between the editor, terminal, and file explorer.
3. In the terminal, use the **Dolphin key+Numpad Plus** (say all) to have the screen read after running a command.
4. For complex output, redirect to a file and open in Notepad: `command > output.txt`, then `notepad output.txt`.

### Dolphin SuperNova Settings for Terminals

1. Open **SuperNova Control Panel** (press Caps Lock+SpaceBar, or click the SuperNova icon).
2. Go to **Speech → Verbosity** and set a comfortable level (3 or 4 recommended for terminal work).
3. Go to **Speech → Text Processing → Indentation** and enable indentation announcement (important for code).
4. Go to **Braille → Settings** if you are using a braille display alongside speech.
5. In **General → Application Settings**, you can set terminal-specific verbosity so SuperNova behaves differently in your terminal versus other programs.

**Note:** Dolphin SuperNova's magnification features can be helpful if you have some remaining vision. Terminal text can be magnified while still receiving speech output.

## General Terminal Accessibility {#general-terminal}

### Understanding the Terminal Layout

All terminals (PowerShell, CMD, Git Bash) follow the same basic layout:
1. **Title bar:** Window name (e.g., "Windows PowerShell", "Command Prompt", "Git Bash")
2. **Content area:** Command history and output
3. **Prompt:** The area where you type (e.g., `PS>`, `C:\>`, `$`)

**Your screen reader reads from top to bottom, but focus is at the prompt (bottom).**

### Navigation Sequence

**When you open any terminal:**
1. Your screen reader announces the window title.
2. Then it announces the prompt line.
3. Anything before the prompt is previous output.
4. Anything after the prompt is where new output will appear.

### Reading Output Effectively

**Strategy 1: Immediate Output (Small Amount)**
- Run a command.
- Your screen reader announces output immediately.
- This works well for short outputs (a few lines).

**Strategy 2: Large Output (Many Lines)**
- Redirect to a file: `command > output.txt`
- Open the file: `notepad output.txt` (works in all shells on Windows)
- Read in Notepad — easier and more controllable for all screen readers.

**Strategy 3: Filtering Output**
- Use filtering commands to reduce output.
- PowerShell: `command | Select-String "pattern"`
- CMD: `command | find "pattern"`
- Git Bash: `command | grep "pattern"`

---

## Working with Long Output {#long-output}

This is one of the most common challenges for screen reader users. Here are proven solutions:

### Solution 1: Redirect to a File (Recommended)

```
command > output.txt
notepad output.txt
```

**Advantages:** Easy to navigate at your own pace, works with all screen readers, output does not scroll away, you can save it for later reference.

### Solution 2: Use Pagination

```
command | more
```

Press **Space** to see the next page, **Q** to quit. Note: some screen readers struggle with `more`; Solution 1 is generally preferred.

### Solution 3: Filter Output

```
# PowerShell
ls | Select-String "\.scad"

# CMD
dir | find ".scad"

# Git Bash
ls -la | grep ".scad"
```

### Solution 4: Count Before Displaying

```powershell
# PowerShell
(ls).Count
```

This tells you how many items there are before deciding whether to redirect to a file.

| **File extension** | `.ps1`              | `.bat`          | `.sh`         |
| **Comment**        | `#`                 | `REM` or `::`   | `#`           |
| **Variable**       | `$var = "value"`    | `set var=value` | `var=value`   |
| **Echo text**      | `Write-Host "text"` | `echo text`     | `echo text`   |
| **Get help**       | `Get-Help command`  | `help command`  | `man command` |

**Choose ONE pathway and stick with it.** Each curriculum teaches you the concepts using that specific shell's syntax. The accessibility experience is virtually identical across all four screen readers in all three shells — only the command syntax differs.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

### Problem 1: "I Can't Hear the Output After Running a Command"

**Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Cursor is not at the prompt** — Press **End** or **Ctrl+End** to go to the end of text, then use screen reader commands to review.
2. **Output scrolled off-screen** — Redirect to file: `command > output.txt`, then `notepad output.txt`.
3. **Screen reader focus is on window title, not content** — Press **Tab** or arrow keys to move into the content area.
4. **Large output overwhelming screen reader** — Use filtering: `command | grep "pattern"` (Git Bash), `command | find "text"` (CMD), or `command | Select-String "text"` (PowerShell).

### Problem 2: "Tab Completion Isn't Working"

1. You must type at least one character before pressing Tab.
2. The folder or file must exist — run `dir` (CMD), `ls` (PowerShell/Git Bash) to check.
3. If multiple matches exist, press Tab again to cycle through them.

### Problem 3: "Access Denied or Permission Denied"

1. Close your terminal, right-click it, and choose **Run as administrator**. Confirm the UAC prompt.
2. If the file is in use by another program, close that program and try again.
3. If the path contains spaces, use quotes: `cd "Program Files"`.

### Problem 4: "A Command Runs Forever and Won't Stop"

Press **Ctrl+C** to interrupt any running command.

### Problem 5: "I Need to Edit My Last Command"

1. Press **Up Arrow** to recall the previous command.
2. Use **Left/Right Arrow** keys to move through it.
3. Edit as needed and press **Enter** to run the modified version.

### Problem 6: Screen Reader is Not Announcing Indentation

Proper indent announcement is critical for reading code. Enable it for your screen reader:

- **NVDA:** NVDA Menu → Preferences → Settings → Document Formatting → enable **"Report indentation"**, set to **"Tones and speech"**.
- **JAWS:** Settings Center → search **"Indent"** → enable **"Announce Indentation"**, set mode to **"Tones"** or **"Tones and Speech"**.
- **Windows Narrator:** Settings → Accessibility → Narrator → Advanced Options → enable **"Report indentation"** (limited options compared to NVDA/JAWS).
- **Dolphin SuperNova:** SuperNova Control Panel → Speech → Text Processing → Indentation → enable and set preferred announcement style.

## Pro Tips for Efficiency

### Create Aliases for Frequently Used Commands

**PowerShell:** `Set-Alias -Name ll -Value "Get-ChildItem -Name"`  
**CMD:** Create a `.bat` file in a folder on your PATH.  
**Git Bash:** `alias ll='ls -la'` (add to `~/.bashrc` to make permanent)

### Use Command History

All shells support **Up/Down Arrow** to navigate history. In PowerShell, `history` shows a numbered list and `Invoke-History 5` reruns command number 5. In Git Bash, `history` and `!5` work similarly.

### Redirect Everything to Files for Accessibility

If a command produces output, save it:

```plaintext
command > results.txt
notepad results.txt
```

This is always more accessible than reading from the terminal directly.

## Quick Reference Card

```plaintext
EVERY SESSION STARTS WITH:
1. pwd / cd            (where am I?)
2. dir / ls            (what is here?)
3. cd path             (go there)

LONG OUTPUT?
-> command > file.txt
-> notepad file.txt

STUCK?
-> Ctrl+C

WANT TO REPEAT?
-> Up Arrow

NEED HELP?
-> PowerShell:  `Get-Help command-name`
-> CMD:         `help command-name`
-> Git Bash:    `man command-name`
```
