## Core File Manipulation Commands

### Create Folders: `mkdir`

```cmd
mkdir FolderName                     :: Create a single folder
mkdir Folder1 Folder2 Folder3        :: Create multiple folders at once
mkdir A\B\C                          :: Create nested folders (A, then B inside A, then C inside B)
```

### Create Files: `echo` with Redirection

```cmd
echo This is some content > filename.txt    :: Create a file with text content
echo. > emptyfile.txt                       :: Create an empty file
```

Note: `echo.` (echo followed immediately by a period, no space) creates an empty file. `echo` with a space would put a space character in the file.

### Copy Files: `copy`

```cmd
copy source.txt destination.txt          :: Copy a file to a new name
copy source.txt backup\                  :: Copy a file into a folder
copy *.txt backup\                       :: Copy all .txt files to backup folder
```

### Copy Folders: `xcopy`

```cmd
xcopy sourcefolder destinationfolder /E /I    :: Copy a folder and all its contents
```

- `/E` copies all subdirectories including empty ones.
- `/I` treats the destination as a folder (not a file) if it doesn't exist.

### Move and Rename: `move`

```cmd
move oldname.txt newname.txt             :: Rename a file
move file.txt folder\                    :: Move a file into a folder
move *.txt archive\                      :: Move all .txt files to archive folder
```

`move` renames when both source and destination are in the same folder. It moves when the destination is a different folder.

### Delete Files: `del`

```cmd
del filename.txt                         :: Delete one specific file
del *.txt                                :: Delete all .txt files in current folder
del /Q *.tmp                             :: Delete quietly (no confirmation prompt)
```

**Warning:** `del` does not send files to the Recycle Bin. Deleted files are gone immediately.

### Delete Folders: `rmdir`

```cmd
rmdir foldername                         :: Delete an empty folder
rmdir /S /Q foldername                   :: Delete a folder and ALL its contents (no undo)
```

**Warning:** `rmdir /S` is permanent. Always verify the folder name before running this command.

## Safe File Operations

### Rule 1: Always Check Before Deleting

```cmd
dir /B                   :: See exactly what is here
dir /B *.txt             :: See exactly which .txt files exist
del *.txt                :: Only then delete
```

### Rule 2: Make Backups First

```cmd
mkdir backup
copy *.txt backup\       :: Copy all .txt files to a backup folder first
del *.txt                :: Now safe to delete originals
```

### Rule 3: Test on One File First

```cmd
del test-one-file.txt    :: Test deletion on a single file
dir /B                   :: Confirm it is gone
```

Only then proceed with bulk operations.

## Using Wildcards

Wildcards let you operate on multiple files matching a pattern.

### `*` Wildcard (Match Any Number of Characters)

```cmd
dir /B *.txt             :: List all files ending in .txt
copy *.scad backup\      :: Copy all .scad files to backup
del *.tmp                :: Delete all .tmp files
```

### `?` Wildcard (Match Exactly One Character)

```cmd
dir /B file?.txt         :: Matches file1.txt, file2.txt, filea.txt, etc.
copy model?.scad models\ :: Copy model1.scad, model2.scad, etc.
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Create a Project Structure

```cmd
mkdir 3DProjects
cd 3DProjects
mkdir Models Prints Documentation Backups
dir /B /A:D
```

### Example 2: Backup Before Editing

```cmd
copy project.scad project-backup.scad    :: Create a backup copy
:: (edit project.scad)
copy project.scad project-v2.scad        :: Save a new versioned copy
```

### Example 3: Organize Files by Type

```cmd
mkdir scad-files
mkdir text-files
move *.scad scad-files\
move *.txt text-files\
dir /B /A:D
```

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create a Folder Structure

1. `mkdir practice-session`
2. `cd practice-session`
3. `mkdir files documents models`
4. `dir /B /A:D`

**Goal:** Create organized folder structures confidently.

### Exercise 2: Create and Copy Files

1. `echo Hello World > test.txt`
2. `type test.txt`
3. `copy test.txt test-backup.txt`
4. `dir /B *.txt`
5. `type test-backup.txt`

**Goal:** Create and copy files without errors.

### Exercise 3: Safe Deletion Practice

1. `echo content > file1.txt`
2. `echo content > file2.txt`
3. `echo content > file3.txt`
4. `dir /B *.txt` (confirm all three exist)
5. `del file1.txt` (delete just one)
6. `dir /B *.txt` (confirm only two remain)

**Goal:** Practice the "check, then delete" pattern.

### Exercise 4: Wildcard Operations

1. Create three files: `echo a > doc1.txt`, `echo b > doc2.txt`, `echo c > doc3.txt`
2. `dir /B *.txt`
3. `mkdir archive`
4. `copy *.txt archive\`
5. `cd archive`
6. `dir /B *.txt`

**Goal:** Comfortable using wildcards for bulk operations.

## Screen Reader Tips

### NVDA Users

After file operations, run `dir /B` and press **NVDA+Down Arrow** to verify results. Redirect output to a file for complex verification: `dir /B > check.txt`, then `notepad.exe check.txt`.

### JAWS Users

After file operations, run `dir /B` and press **Insert+Down Arrow** to read results. For complex output: `dir /B > check.txt`, then `notepad.exe check.txt`.

### Windows Narrator Users

After file operations, run `dir /B` and press **Narrator+R** to read from the current position. Redirect to a file and open in Notepad for long output.

### Dolphin SuperNova Users

After file operations, run `dir /B` and press **CapsLock+Numpad Plus** to read results. For long output: `dir /B > check.txt`, then `notepad.exe check.txt`.

### General Tip for All Screen Readers

After any `copy`, `move`, or `del` operation, always verify with `dir /B` to confirm the expected result. Never assume an operation worked without checking.

## Checkpoint Questions

1. How do you create a folder?
2. How do you copy a file?
3. How do you rename a file?
4. How do you delete a file safely (checking first)?
5. What does `*` match in a wildcard pattern?
6. What does `?` match in a wildcard pattern?
7. How would you copy all .scad files to a backup folder?
8. What should you always do before deleting?
9. How do you delete a folder and all its contents?

---

## Extension Problems

1. Create a nested folder structure (5+ levels) using a single `mkdir` command with backslashes.
2. Create 10 files and organize them into subfolders using `move` with wildcards.
3. Create a date-based backup strategy: copy all files to a folder named with today's date.
4. Use wildcards to select specific file types and copy them to separate organized folders.
5. Create a file-renaming system (file001.txt, file002.txt, etc.) and practice moving them between folders.
