Duration: 1 class period
Prerequisite: PS-2 (File and Folder Manipulation)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Use `echo` to print text to the screen
- Use `cat` to read file contents
- Use `>` to redirect output into a file
- Use `|` (pipe) to send one command's output to another
- Copy output to the clipboard with `clip`
- Open files with a text editor from the command line

## Commands Covered

| Command                | What It Does                                    |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `echo "text"`          | Print text to the screen                        |
| `cat filename`         | Print the contents of a file                    |
| `> filename`           | Redirect output into a file (overwrites)        |
| `>> filename`          | Append output to a file (adds to end)           |
| `\|`                   | Pipe - send output from one command to the next |
| `clip`                 | Copy piped input to the Windows clipboard       |
| `notepad.exe filename` | Open a file in Notepad                          |

## `echo` - Printing Text

`echo` prints text to the screen. It is useful for testing, for writing text into files, and for understanding how piping works.

```powershell
echo "Hello, World"
echo "This is a test"
```

## `cat` - Reading Files

`cat` prints the contents of a file to the screen.

```powershell
# Read a text file
cat ~/Documents/notes.txt
# Read an OpenSCAD file
cat ~/Documents/OpenSCAD_Projects/project0.scad
```

With a long file, use `cat filename | more` to read it page by page (press `Space` to advance, `Q` to quit).

## `>` - Redirecting Output to a File

The `>` symbol redirects output from the screen into a file instead.

```powershell
# Create a file with a single line
echo "Author: Your Name" > header.txt
# Confirm the file was created and has content
cat header.txt
```

> [!WARNING]
>  `>` overwrites the file if it already exists. Use `>>` to append instead:

```powershell
echo "Date: 2025" >> header.txt
echo "Project: Floor Marker" >> header.txt
cat header.txt
```

## `|` - Piping

The pipe symbol `|` sends the output of one command to the input of the next. This lets you chain commands together.

```powershell
# List files and send the list to clip (copies to clipboard)
ls -n | clip
# Now paste with Ctrl + V anywhere
```

```powershell
# Search within a file's contents using Select-String (like grep)
cat project0.scad | Select-String "cube"
```

## `clip` - Copying to Clipboard

`clip` takes whatever is piped to it and puts it on the Windows clipboard.

```powershell
# Copy your current directory path to the clipboard
pwd | clip
# Copy a file listing to clipboard
ls -n | clip
# Copy the contents of a file to clipboard
cat notes.txt | clip
```

After any of these, press `Ctrl + V` in any application to paste.

## Opening Files in Notepad

```powershell
# Open a file in Notepad
notepad.exe ~/Documents/notes.txt
# Open a .scad file
notepad.exe ~/Documents/OpenSCAD_Projects/project0.scad
# Create a new file and open it
notepad new_notes.txt
```

## Step-by-step Tasks
1. Create `practice.txt` with three lines using `echo` and `>`/`>>`.
2. Read the file with `cat practice.txt`.
3. Pipe the file into `Select-String` to search for a word.
4. Copy the file contents to clipboard with `cat practice.txt | clip`.
5. Redirect `ls -n` into `list.txt` and open it in Notepad.
Checkpoints
- After step 3 you should be able to find a keyword using piping.

## Quiz - Lesson PS.3
1. What is the difference between `>` and `>>`?
2. What does the pipe `|` do?
3. How do you copy output to the clipboard?
4. How would you page through long output?
5. How do you suppress output to nowhere?
6. True or False: The pipe operator `|` connects the output of one command to the input of another.
7. Explain why redirecting output to a file is useful for screen reader users.
8. Write a command that would search for the word "sphere" in all `.scad` files in a directory.
9. How would you count the number of lines in a file using PowerShell piping?
10. Describe a practical scenario in 3D printing where you would pipe or redirect command output.
11. What would be the difference in output between `echo "test" > file.txt` (run twice) vs `echo "test" >> file.txt` (run twice)? Show the expected file contents.
12. Design a three-step piping chain: read a file, filter for specific content, and save the results; explain what each pipe does.
13. You have a 500-line `.scad` file and need to find all instances of `sphere()` and count them. Write the command.
14. Explain how `clip` is particularly valuable for screen reader users when working with file paths or long output strings.
15. Describe how you would use pipes and redirection to create a timestamped backup report of all `.stl` files in a 3D printing project folder.
## Extension Problems
1. Use piping to count lines in a file (hint: `Select-String -Pattern '.' | Measure-Object`).
2. Save a long `ls -n` output and search it with `Select-String`.
3. Chain multiple pipes to filter and then save results.
4. Practice copying different command outputs to clipboard and pasting.
5. Create a small script that generates a report (counts of files by extension).
6. Build a data processing pipeline: read a CSV file, filter rows, and export results; document each step.
7. Write a script that pipes directory listing to Count occurrences of each file extension; create a summary report.
8. Create a log analysis command: read a log file, filter for errors, and save matching lines to a separate error log.
9. Design a piping workflow for 3D printing file management: find `.stl` files, extract their sizes, and generate a report.
10. Develop a reusable piping function library: create functions for common filtering, sorting, and reporting patterns; test each function with different inputs.
11. Build a complex filter pipeline: read a `.scad` file, extract lines containing specific geometry commands, count each type, and output a summary to both screen and file.
12. Create an interactive piping tool: build a script that accepts user input for a search term, pipes through multiple filters, and displays paginated results.
13. Develop a performance analysis tool: use piping to combine file listing, metadata extraction, and statistical reporting; export results to a dated report file.
14. Implement a comprehensive error-handling pipeline: read output, catch errors, log them separately, and generate a summary of successes vs failures.
15. Design and execute a real-world project backup workflow: use piping to verify file integrity, count files by type, generate a backup manifest, and create audit logs-all in one integrated command pipeline.
