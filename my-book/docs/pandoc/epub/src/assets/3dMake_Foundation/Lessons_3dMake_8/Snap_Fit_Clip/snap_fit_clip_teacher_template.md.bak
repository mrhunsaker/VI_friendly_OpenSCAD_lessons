# Snap-Fit Clip - Teacher Template (Extension Project) {#assets_3dmake_foundation_lessons_3dmake_8_snap_fit_clip-snap_fit_clip_teacher_template}

## Briefing

Students design a snap-fit connector that joins two 3D-printed parts without fasteners. This project emphasizes tolerance engineering, material properties, and mechanical design validation.

Key Learning: Tolerance engineering; snap-fit mechanics; non-destructive assembly testing.

Real-world Connection: Snap-fits are ubiquitous in consumer products. Designing them requires understanding material stress, geometry precision, and repeated-use durability.

## Constraints
- Snap-fit must connect two printed parts without external fasteners
- Design must be parametric (tolerance variables clearly labeled)
- Assembly must be testable (connection strength, reusability)
- Design must account for material properties (PLA creep, flex limits)

## Functional Requirements
- Parts snap together securely without over-constraint
- Connection withstands intended use without permanent deformation
- Snap mechanism is reusable (at least 5+ assembly cycles)
- Design demonstrates understanding of tolerance and material behavior

## Deliverables
- `.scad` with parametric snap-fit module
- Completed documentation template
- Assembly testing log (snap strength, cycle durability)
- Tolerance analysis documentation
- Reflection on mechanical design trade-offs

## Rubric

### Category 1: Problem & Solution (0-3)
Snap-fit works reliably; parts assemble and disassemble as designed.

### Category 2: Design & Code Quality (0-3)
Code shows tolerance thinking. Design is mechanically sound.

### Category 3: Documentation (0-3)
Assembly testing documented. Tolerance rationale explained.

## Assessment Notes

- Strong submissions: Show evidence of tolerance testing, multiple assembly cycles documented, and reflection on material limits
- Reinforce: Snap-fit design principles; tolerancing for manufacturability
- Extension: Material property analysis; cost-benefit comparisons
