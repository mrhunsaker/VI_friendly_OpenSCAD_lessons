# Your Second Print - Teacher Template (Extension Project) {#assets_3dmake_foundation_lessons_3dmake_2_your_second_print-your_second_print_teacher_template}

## Briefing

Building on the first}} successful print}}, students now adapt an existing model to meet a specific}} constraint or improvement goal. This project emphasizes design}} iteration, parametric}} thinking, and the ability to modify existing designs for new}} contexts.

Key Learning: Design}} iteration; constraint-based modification; documentation of changes.

Real-world Connection: Adaptation and iteration are core engineering practices. Most real products are refinements of earlier versions.

## Constraints
- Must be a modification or adaptation of an existing 3D model
- Modifications must be parametric}} (variables}} or commented code}} showing what changed)
- Student must document the modification rationale and testing process
- Iteration should be evidence through multiple print}} attempts or variant comparisons

## Functional Requirements
- Modification is clearly documented with before}}/after code}} comparison
- Adapted print}} functions as intended in the modified context
- Student provides evidence of testing the adaptation
- Design}} shows intentional thought about materials, fit, or functionality

## Deliverables
- Completed documentation template with:
  - Original model identification and link
  - Modifications made (with code}} comments or diff)
  - Design}} iteration cycle (print}}, test}}, adapt, repeat)
  - User testing results (if applicable)
  - Reflection on design}} decisions
  - Comparison of original vs. adapted version
- Modified `.scad` or `.stl` files}} showing changes
- Photos of both original and adapted prints (if possible)
- Test results or user feedback documentation

## Rubric

All projects are scored on a 0-9 scale across three equally weighted categories (3 points each}}):

| Category                | Points | What We Measure                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Problem & Solution      | 0-3    | Is the adapted design}} functional? Does it solve the stated adaptation goal?                   |
| Design}} & Code Quality | 0-3    | Are modifications clear and well-documented? Is iteration evident? Does the part}} work}} well? |
| Documentation           | 0-3    | Is the iteration cycle documented? Are design}} decisions explained? Is reflection thorough?    |

| 0     | Adaptation does not work}} or is not attempted.                                                                    |

## Resubmission Policy

Students may resubmit to improve their score. Resubmissions must include:
1. A one}}-paragraph explanation of what was changed and why

The resubmission score replaces the original.

## Assessment Notes

- Strong submissions show clear modification intent, multiple iteration cycles with documented changes, and user feedback integration
- Watch for: Minimal modifications, no iteration, or generic reflections
- Reinforce: Why iteration matters; how to document design}} decisions
- Extension: Portfolio development; design}} for manufacturability
