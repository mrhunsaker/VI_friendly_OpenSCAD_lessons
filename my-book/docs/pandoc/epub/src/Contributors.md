His career uniquely bridges scientific research, clinical experience, and classroom practice-positioning him to design accessible educational materials grounded in both neuroscience and practical pedagogy."], Header 3 ("research--clinical-background", ["unnumbered", "unlisted"], []) [Str "Research & Clinical Background"], Para [Str "Following his doctoral work at UC Davis (2012), Dr. Hunsaker completed postdoctoral research in primate neural development at the UC Davis MIND Institute, where he developed sophisticated research methods to evaluate developmental disorders. During this period, he gained extensive clinical experience working directly with children and adults across a broad spectrum of diagnoses, including autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, genetic conditions (fragile X syndrome, Williams syndrome, 22q11.2DS, Down syndrome), ADHD, and Tourette's syndrome. This diverse exposure to different neurological profiles taught him a crucial lesson: each learner's disability uniquely shapes their cognitive strengths, learning preferences, and educational needs."], Header 3 ("transition-to-education", ["unnumbered", "unlisted"], []) [Str "Transition to Education"], Para [Str "In 2013, recognizing the gap between academic research and classroom reality, Dr. Hunsaker made a deliberate career shift to direct education. Rather than pursue traditional academic pathways, he committed to applying his scientific training to help students in real classroom environments. As a special education teacher, he focused on understanding the individual relationship between disability and learning-developing instructional approaches that enable students to access their full potential rather than working around perceived limitations."], Header 3 ("expertise-in-accessibility--inclusive-design", ["unnumbered", "unlisted"], []) [Str "Expertise in Accessibility & Inclusive Design"], Para [Str "His specialization in teaching blind and visually impaired students, particularly those with additional disabilities, has given Dr. Hunsaker deep expertise in accessible pedagogy and non-visual problem-solving. He grounds all curriculum design in evidence-based practice informed by neuroscience, accessibility research, and years of direct classroom experience with diverse learners. He understands that accessibility is not an afterthought or accommodation; it is the foundation upon which effective education for all students is built."], Header 3 ("creator-of-accessible-educational-resources", ["unnumbered", "unlisted"], []) [Str "Creator of Accessible Educational Resources"], Para [Str "Motivated by observing persistent gaps in affordable, practical, and culturally responsive accessible educational materials, Dr. Hunsaker created ", Strong [Str "TVI Resources"], Str ", a collection of free, openly licensed instructional materials designed to meet the real needs of educators and students. This commitment to accessible education informed his development of this curriculum: a comprehensive, text-based approach to 3D design and digital fabrication specifically engineered for blind and visually impaired learners, emphasizing independence, technical mastery, and real-world application."], Header 2 ("acknowledgements", ["unnumbered", "unlisted"], []) [Str "Acknowledgements"], Para [Str "This curriculum stands on the shoulders of innovators, educators, and open-source maintainers whose commitment to accessibility and open education made this work possible."], Header 3 ("3dmake", ["unnumbered", "unlisted"], []) [Str "3DMake"], Para [Str "Special thanks to Troy Deck, the creator and maintainer of ", Strong [Link ("", [], []) [Str "3DMake"] ("https://github.com/tdeck/3dmake", "")], Str ", an open-source command-line tool that automates the workflow from code-based 3D models to print-ready files. 3DMake is essential to this curriculum-it eliminates the visual GUI entirely and makes parametric 3D design accessible to screen reader users through text-based commands and configuration files.

OpenSCAD's text-based programming model and screen-reader-compatible approach to geometry design makes it uniquely suited for learners who use assistive technology. The OpenSCAD community's commitment to open-source principles and accessibility embodies the philosophy that drives this curriculum."], Header 3 ("open-education--accessibility-movement", ["unnumbered", "unlisted"], []) [Str "Open Education & Accessibility Movement"], Para [Str "Finally, this curriculum is part of a broader movement toward open educational resources that prioritize accessibility from the ground up. It reflects the conviction that education should be barrier-free, that students with disabilities bring unique perspectives and strengths, and that accessible design benefits all learners. The work of accessibility advocates, neurodivergent educators, and disability justice activists informed every decision in building this material."], HorizontalRule]
