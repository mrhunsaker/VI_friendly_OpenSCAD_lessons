Poor adhesion causes warping. Improved by using a heated bed, glue stick, or painter's tape."], Para [Strong [Str "Boolean operation"], Str " - An operation that combines or subtracts 3D shapes.

Generated by the slicer."], Para [Strong [Str "Hot end / nozzle"], Str " - The heated component that melts and extrudes the filament. Typically heated to 200-250C depending on material."], Para [Strong [Str "Infill"], Str " - The internal structure of a printed object.

Removed after the print is complete."], Para [Strong [Str "Tolerance"], Str " - The acceptable amount of dimensional variation in a printed part. FDM printers typically have a tolerance of +/-0.15-0.30 mm."], Para [Strong [Str "TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane)"], Str " - A flexible filament used for rubber-like parts: phone cases, wearables, shock absorbers.
