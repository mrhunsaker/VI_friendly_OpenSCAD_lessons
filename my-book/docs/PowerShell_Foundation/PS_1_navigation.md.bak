**Duration:** 1 class period
**Prerequisite:** PS-0 (Getting Started)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Use `pwd` to print your current location
- Use `cd` to move between directories
- Use `ls` (and its flags) to list files and folders
- Use wildcards `*` and `?` to filter listings
- Navigate relative vs. absolute paths

## Commands Covered in This Lesson

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `pwd` | Print Working Directory — shows where you are |
| `cd path` | Change Directory — move to a new location |
| `ls` | List — shows files and folders in current location |
| `ls -n` | List names only (screen reader friendly) |
| `ls -n -af` | List names of files only |
| `ls -n -ad` | List names of directories only |

---

## `pwd` — Where Am I?

Type `pwd` and press `Enter`. PowerShell prints the full path to your current location.

```powershell
pwd
# Output: C:\Users\YourName
```

Use this whenever you are unsure where you are.

## `cd` — Changing Directories

`cd` stands for "change directory."

```powershell
# PS-1: Navigation — Moving Around Your File System (Self-Paced)

Estimated time: 25–40 minutes

**Learning Objectives**
- Use `pwd` to confirm location
- Use `cd` to move through relative and absolute paths
- Use `ls -n` and wildcards to find files

**Materials**
- PowerShell
- Editor

Step-by-step Tasks
1. Run `pwd` and read the returned path aloud.
2. Move to `Documents` with `cd Documents`, confirm with `pwd`.
3. Use `ls -n` and `ls -n -af` to list files only and directories only.
4. Practice using `*` and `?` wildcards to list matching files.
5. Return home with `cd ~`.

Checkpoints
- After task 2 you can state the path printed by `pwd`.

Quick Quiz
1. What does `pwd` show?
2. How do you list directories only with `ls`?
3. What wildcard matches any number of characters?
4. How do you list files with the `.scad` extension?
5. Give an example of an absolute path and a relative path.

Extension Problems
1. Write a one-line script that lists `.scad` files and saves to `scad_list.txt`.
2. Use `ls -n ~/Documents | more` to page through long listings.
3. Combine `ls` with `Select-String` to search for a filename pattern.
4. Create a shortcut alias in the session for a long path and test it.
5. Practice tab-completion in a directory with many similarly named files.
