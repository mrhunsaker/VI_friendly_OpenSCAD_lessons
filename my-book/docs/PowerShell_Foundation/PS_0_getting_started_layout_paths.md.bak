# PS-0: Getting Started — Layout, Paths, and the Shell (Self-Paced)

Estimated time: 20–30 minutes

**Learning Objectives**
- Launch PowerShell and locate the prompt
- Understand path notation and shortcuts (`~`, `./`, `../`)
- Use tab completion to navigate quickly

**Materials**
- Computer with PowerShell
- Editor (Notepad/VS Code)

Step-by-step Tasks
1. Open PowerShell and note the prompt (it includes the current path).
2. Run `pwd` and say or note the printed path.
3. Use `ls -n` to list names in your home directory.
4. Practice `cd Documents`, `cd ../` and `cd ~` until comfortable.
5. Try tab-completion: type `cd ~/D` and press Tab.

Checkpoints
- Confirm you can state your current path and move to `Documents`.

Quick Quiz
1. What is a path?
2. What does `~` mean?
3. How do you autocomplete a path?
4. How do you go up one directory?
5. What command lists only names (`ls` flag)?

Extension Problems
1. Create a nested folder and practice `cd` into it by typing partial names and using Tab.
2. Use `ls -n -af` to list only files in a folder.
3. Save `pwd` output to a file and open it in Notepad.
4. Try `cd` into a folder whose name contains spaces; observe how quotes are handled.
5. Create a short note file and open it from PowerShell.
