# PS-5: Filling in the Gaps — Control Flow, Profiles, and Useful Tricks (Self-Paced)

Estimated time: 30–45 minutes

**Learning Objectives**
- Use history and abort commands (`history`, `Ctrl+C`)
- Inspect and edit your PowerShell profile for persistent settings
- Run programs by full path using the `&` operator
- Handle common screen reader edge cases when using the terminal

**Materials**
- PowerShell and an editor (Notepad/VS Code)

Step-by-step Tasks
1. Run several simple commands (e.g., `pwd`, `ls -n`, `echo hi`) then run `history` to view them.
2. Use `Invoke-History <n>` to re-run a previous command (replace `<n>` with a history number).
3. Practice aborting a long-running command with `Ctrl + C` (for example, `ping 8.8.8.8`).
4. Open your profile: `notepad.exe $PROFILE`; if it doesn't exist, create it: `ni $PROFILE -Force`.
5. Add a persistent alias line to your profile (example: `Set-Alias -Name preview -Value openscad`), save, and reopen PowerShell to verify.

Checkpoints
- After step 2 you can re-run a recent command by history number.
- After step 5 your alias should persist across sessions.

Quick Quiz (5)
1. How do you view the command history?
2. Which key combination aborts a running command?
3. What does `echo $PROFILE` show?
4. How does the `&` operator help run executables?
5. What is one strategy if terminal output stops being announced by your screen reader?

Extension Problems (5)
1. Add an alias and an environment variable change to your profile and document the behavior after reopening PowerShell.
2. Create a short script that automates creating a project folder and an initial .scad file.
3. Experiment with running OpenSCAD by full path using `&` and by placing it in PATH; compare results.
4. Practice redirecting `Get-Help` output to a file and reading it in Notepad for screen reader clarity.
5. Document three screen reader troubleshooting steps you used and when they helped.
