**Duration:** 1 class period
**Prerequisite:** PS-2 (File and Folder Manipulation)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Use `echo` to print text to the screen
- Use `cat` to read file contents
- Use `>` to redirect output into a file
- Use `|` (pipe) to send one command's output to another
- Copy output to the clipboard with `clip`
- Open files with a text editor from the command line

## Commands Covered

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `echo "text"` | Print text to the screen |
| `cat filename` | Print the contents of a file |
| `> filename` | Redirect output into a file (overwrites) |
| `>> filename` | Append output to a file (adds to end) |
| `\|` | Pipe — send output from one command to the next |
| `clip` | Copy piped input to the Windows clipboard |
| `notepad.exe filename` | Open a file in Notepad |

---

## `echo` — Printing Text

`echo` prints text to the screen. It is useful for testing, for writing text into files, and for understanding how piping works.

```powershell
echo "Hello, World"
echo "This is a test"
```

---

## `cat` — Reading Files

`cat` prints the contents of a file to the screen.

```powershell
# Read a text file
cat ~/Documents/notes.txt

# Read an OpenSCAD file
cat ~/Documents/OpenSCAD_Projects/project0.scad
```

With a long file, use `cat filename | more` to read it page by page (press `Space` to advance, `Q` to quit).

---

## `>` — Redirecting Output to a File

The `>` symbol redirects output from the screen into a file instead.

```powershell
# Create a file with a single line
echo "Author: Your Name" > header.txt

# Confirm the file was created and has content
cat header.txt
```

**Warning:** `>` overwrites the file if it already exists. Use `>>` to append instead:

```powershell
echo "Date: 2025" >> header.txt
echo "Project: Floor Marker" >> header.txt
cat header.txt
```

---

## `|` — Piping

The pipe symbol `|` sends the output of one command to the input of the next. This lets you chain commands together.

```powershell
# List files and send the list to clip (copies to clipboard)
ls -n | clip

# Now paste with Ctrl + V anywhere
```

```powershell
# Search within a file's contents using Select-String (like grep)
cat project0.scad | Select-String "cube"
```

---

## `clip` — Copying to Clipboard

`clip` takes whatever is piped to it and puts it on the Windows clipboard.

```powershell
# Copy your current directory path to the clipboard
pwd | clip

# Copy a file listing to clipboard
ls -n | clip

# Copy the contents of a file to clipboard
cat notes.txt | clip
```

After any of these, press `Ctrl + V` in any application to paste.

---

## Opening Files in Notepad

```powershell
# Open a file in Notepad
notepad.exe ~/Documents/notes.txt

# Open a .scad file
notepad.exe ~/Documents/OpenSCAD_Projects/project0.scad

# Create a new file and open it
ni new_notes.txt
# PS-3: Input, Output, and Piping (Self-Paced)

Estimated time: 25–40 minutes

**Learning Objectives**
- Use `echo`, `cat`, `>` and `>>` for basic IO
- Use `|` to pipe outputs between commands
- Copy command output to the clipboard with `clip`

**Materials**
- PowerShell
- Example text files for practice

Step-by-step Tasks
1. Create `practice.txt` with three lines using `echo` and `>`/`>>`.
2. Read the file with `cat practice.txt`.
3. Pipe the file into `Select-String` to search for a word.
4. Copy the file contents to clipboard with `cat practice.txt | clip`.
5. Redirect `ls -n` into `list.txt` and open it in Notepad.

Checkpoints
- After step 3 you should be able to find a keyword using piping.

Quick Quiz
1. What is the difference between `>` and `>>`?
2. What does the pipe `|` do?
3. How do you copy output to the clipboard?
4. How would you page through long output?
5. How do you suppress output to nowhere?

Extension Problems
1. Use piping to count lines in a file (hint: `Select-String -Pattern '.' | Measure-Object`).
2. Save a long `ls -n` output and search it with `Select-String`.
3. Chain multiple pipes to filter and then save results.
4. Practice copying different command outputs to clipboard and pasting.
5. Create a small script that generates a report (counts of files by extension).
