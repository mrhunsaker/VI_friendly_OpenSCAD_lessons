# PS-4: Environment Variables, PATH, and Aliases (Self-Paced)

Estimated time: 30–45 minutes

**Learning Objectives**
- Read environment variables with `$env:VARNAME`
- Inspect and verify programs in the `PATH`
- Create temporary aliases and understand making them persistent via the profile

**Materials**
- PowerShell (with rights to open profile if desired)

Step-by-step Tasks
1. Show your username and home path with `echo $env:USERNAME` and `echo $env:USERPROFILE`.
2. Inspect `echo $env:PATH` and identify whether `openscad` or `code` would be found.
3. Run `Get-Command openscad` and note the result.
4. Create a temporary alias: `Set-Alias -Name preview -Value openscad` and test `preview myfile.scad`.
5. Open your profile (`notepad.exe $PROFILE`) and add the alias line to make it persistent (advanced).

Checkpoints
- After step 3 you can determine whether a program will be found by `PATH`.

Quick Quiz
1. How do you print an environment variable?
2. What is the purpose of `PATH`?
3. How do you check whether `openscad` is available?
4. How do you create a temporary alias?
5. Where would you make an alias permanent?

Extension Problems
1. Add a folder to PATH for a test program (describe steps; do not change system PATH without admin).
2. Create a short profile snippet that sets two aliases and test re-opening PowerShell.
3. Use `Get-Command` to list the path for several common programs.
4. Explore `$env:TEMP` and create a file there.
5. Save a copy of your current PATH to a text file and examine it in your editor.
