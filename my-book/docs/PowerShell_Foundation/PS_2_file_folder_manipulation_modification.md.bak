# PS-2: File and Folder Manipulation (Self-Paced)

Estimated time: 30–45 minutes

**Learning Objectives**
- Create, copy, move, and delete files and folders from PowerShell
- Use `ni`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, and `rmdir` safely
- Understand when operations are permanent and how to confirm results

**Materials**
- PowerShell
- Small practice folder for exercises

Step-by-step Tasks
1. Create a practice directory: `mkdir ~/Documents/PS_Practice` and `cd` into it.
2. Create two files: `ni file1.txt` and `ni file2.txt`.
3. Copy `file1.txt` to `file1_backup.txt` with `cp` and confirm with `ls -n`.
4. Rename `file2.txt` to `notes.txt` using `mv` and confirm.
5. Delete `file1.txt` with `rm` and verify the backup remains.

Checkpoints
- After step 3 you should see both the original and the backup file.

Quick Quiz
1. How do you create an empty file from PowerShell?
2. What command copies a file?
3. How do you rename a file?
4. What does `rm -r` do?
5. Why is `rm` potentially dangerous?

Extension Problems
1. Create a folder tree and copy it to a new location with `cp -r`.
2. Write a one-line command that creates three files named `a b c` and lists them.
3. Move a file into a new folder and confirm the move.
4. Use wildcards to delete files matching a pattern in a safe test folder.
5. Export a listing of the practice folder to `practice_listing.txt`.
