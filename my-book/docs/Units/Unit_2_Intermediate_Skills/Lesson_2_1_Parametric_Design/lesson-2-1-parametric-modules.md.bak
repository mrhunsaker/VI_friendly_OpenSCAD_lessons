# Lesson 2.1: Parametric Design & Modules in OpenSCAD

**Unit:** 2 — Intermediate Skills  
**Duration:** 1–2 class periods  
**Prerequisite:** Unit 0 (all lessons) and Unit 1 (Projects 0 and 1 complete)

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain what "parametric design" means and why it matters
- Define a `module` in OpenSCAD with parameters
- Call a module with different values to generate variations
- Refactor an existing design to use modules
- Recognize when a module would simplify repeated design elements

## What Is Parametric Design?

When you store a dimension in a variable, you've taken your first step toward parametric design. **Parametric design** means building your model around adjustable parameters so that a single change automatically updates the whole design.

**Example without parametric thinking:**

```scad
cube([70, 16, 5]);
translate([0, 20, 0]) cube([70, 16, 5]);
translate([0, 40, 0]) cube([70, 16, 5]);
```

If you want to change the width from 16 to 20, you must edit three places. If you have 30 of these, that's 30 edits — and you'll probably miss one.

**Example with parametric thinking:**

```scad
w = 16;  // change this one number to update the whole design
cube([70, w, 5]);
translate([0, 20, 0]) cube([70, w, 5]);
translate([0, 40, 0]) cube([70, w, 5]);
```

Better — but there's still a lot of repetition. That's where **modules** come in.

## Modules

A **module** is a reusable block of code. You define it once, give it a name, and then call it by name as many times as you need.

### Basic Module Syntax

```scad
module my_module_name() {
    // your shapes here
    cube([10, 10, 10]);
}

// Call the module:
my_module_name();
```

### Module with Parameters

```scad
module floor_marker(length, width, height) {
    cube([length, width, height]);
}

// Call with different sizes:
floor_marker(70, 16, 5);
translate([0, 30, 0]) floor_marker(50, 12, 3);
```

## Practice: Build a Parametric Box Set

Design a module called `storage_box` that accepts `length`, `width`, `height`, and `wall_thickness` as parameters. The module should create a hollow box (open on top) using `difference()`.

Then call your module three times with different sizes to create a small, medium, and large box arranged side by side.

**Starter code:**

```scad
module storage_box(length = 40, width = 30, height = 20, wall = 2) {
    difference() {
        // outer shell
        cube([length, width, height]);
        
        // inner hollow (remove the inside, keep the walls and bottom)
        translate([wall, wall, wall])
            cube([length - 2*wall, width - 2*wall, height]);
    }
}

// Small box
storage_box(30, 20, 15);

// Medium box — position it next to the small one
translate([35, 0, 0]) storage_box(40, 30, 20);

// Large box — fill in the parameters yourself
translate([80, 0, 0]) storage_box(/* your values */);
```
