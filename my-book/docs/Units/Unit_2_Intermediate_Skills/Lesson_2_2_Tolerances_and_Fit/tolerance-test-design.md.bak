# Tolerance Test Design — Lesson 2.2 Companion

*This document accompanies Lesson 2.2: Tolerances & Fit. Print the test piece, run the tests below, and record your results. Keep this sheet — you will reference your printer's clearance value in every project that requires parts to fit together.*

## What You Are Testing

You printed a set of test blocks, each with a cylindrical hole at a different diameter. You also printed a reference peg with a known diameter. Your goal: find the minimum clearance needed for the peg to fit into a hole, and characterize what each clearance feels like.

---

## Before Testing: Verify the Peg

Measure the reference peg with your calipers:

| Trial | Peg Diameter (mm) |
|-------|------------------|
| 1 | |
| 2 | |
| 3 | |
| **Average** | |

How close is your measured average to the designed value of **5.0 mm**?

Difference: _______ mm

This difference tells you something about your printer's dimensional accuracy on external (outside) dimensions.

---

## Test Results Table

For each test block, try to insert the peg. Record what happens.

| Block | Designed Hole Diameter | Does It Fit? | Fit Description |
|-------|----------------------|-------------|----------------|
| 0.0 mm clearance | 5.0 mm | Yes / No | |
| 0.1 mm clearance | 5.1 mm | Yes / No | |
| 0.2 mm clearance | 5.2 mm | Yes / No | |
| 0.3 mm clearance | 5.3 mm | Yes / No | |
| 0.5 mm clearance | 5.5 mm | Yes / No | |

---

## Also Measure the Holes

Use your calipers to measure the inside diameter of each hole and compare to the designed size:

| Block | Designed Hole (mm) | Measured Hole (mm) | Difference (mm) |
|-------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| 0.0 mm clearance | 5.0 | | |
| 0.2 mm clearance | 5.2 | | |
| 0.5 mm clearance | 5.5 | | |

Are the holes larger or smaller than designed? _______________

## Determine Your Printer's Clearance Values

Based on your test results, fill in the values that work for your printer:

| Fit Type | Clearance Value That Worked |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Press fit (forces in, permanent) | _______ mm |
| Snug fit (removable by hand) | _______ mm |
| Normal / loose fit (slides easily) | _______ mm |
| Free sliding (moves with no resistance) | _______ mm |

**My printer's standard clearance for a normal fit: _______ mm**

## Reflection Questions

1. Were the holes printed larger or smaller than designed? By roughly how much?

___________________________________________________________________________

2. Why do you think FDM printers consistently produce holes that are a different size than designed?

___________________________________________________________________________

3. You are designing a hinge where two parts need to rotate freely against each other. Based on your test results, what clearance would you use between the two surfaces?

___________________________________________________________________________

4. You are designing a cap that needs to snap onto a cylindrical post and stay in place. What clearance would you use?
