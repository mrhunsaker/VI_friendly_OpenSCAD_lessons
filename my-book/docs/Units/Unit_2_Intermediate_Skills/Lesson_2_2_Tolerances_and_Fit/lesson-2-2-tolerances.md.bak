# Lesson 2.2: Tolerances & Fit in 3D Printing

**Unit:** 2 — Intermediate Skills  
**Duration:** 1–2 class periods (plus a print session)  
**Prerequisite:** Lesson 2.1; understanding of calipers (Lesson 0.3)

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain why 3D printed objects do not exactly match their designed dimensions
- Define tolerance, clearance, and the three types of fit (clearance, transition, interference)
- Design and print a tolerance test part to characterize their specific printer
- Apply appropriate tolerance values when designing parts that must fit together
- Understand why holes in printed parts are always slightly undersized

## The Problem: Your Print Won't Be Exactly the Right Size

When you type `cube([20, 20, 20])` in OpenSCAD, you expect a 20 mm cube. In practice, **FDM printing introduces small dimensional errors** — typically ±0.1 to ±0.3 mm for a desktop printer.

This matters enormously when designing parts that:
- Must fit over, around, or inside another object
- Must snap or press together with another printed part
- Must slide freely against another surface

## Tolerance Test Design

This lesson includes a printable tolerance test (separate file). Print it, test peg/hole fits, and record your results.
