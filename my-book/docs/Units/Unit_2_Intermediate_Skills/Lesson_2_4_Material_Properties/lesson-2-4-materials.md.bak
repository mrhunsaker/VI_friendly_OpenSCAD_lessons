# Lesson 2.4: Material Properties — PLA, PETG, and TPU

**Unit:** 2 — Intermediate Skills  
**Duration:** 1 class period (50–60 min)  
**Prerequisite:** Lessons 0.1 (Safety) and 0.6 (Slicing)

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Compare the physical properties of PLA, PETG, and TPU
- Choose an appropriate filament material for a given design application
- Explain how printing settings change when switching materials
- Describe the safety considerations specific to each material

---

## The Three Materials

### PLA — Polylactic Acid

PLA is the standard starting point for FDM printing. It is bio-derived (from corn starch or sugarcane) and relatively low-emission.

### PETG — Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol-Modified

PETG is described as combining the ease of PLA with the toughness of ABS. It's more durable and heat-resistant than PLA.

### TPU — Thermoplastic Polyurethane

TPU is a **flexible filament** — it bends, stretches, and returns to its shape like rubber.
