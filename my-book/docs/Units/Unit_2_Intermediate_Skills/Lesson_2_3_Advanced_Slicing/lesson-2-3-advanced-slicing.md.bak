# Lesson 2.3: Advanced Slicing — Supports, Orientation & Print Strength

**Unit:** 2 — Intermediate Skills  
**Duration:** 1–2 class periods  
**Prerequisite:** Lesson 0.6 (Intro to Slicing)

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Identify which features of a model require support structures
- Understand the 45-degree overhang rule
- Choose an optimal print orientation to minimize supports and maximize strength
- Compare the same model sliced in different orientations
- Use PrusaSlicer's layer preview to diagnose potential print problems

## The 45-Degree Overhang Rule

FDM printing builds layer by layer, from the bottom up. Each layer must rest on either:
1. The layer below it
2. A support structure

An **overhang** is any surface that extends beyond the layer below. FDM printers can handle overhangs up to about **45 degrees** from vertical without supports, because each new layer has enough material below it to hold its position.

## Practice Activity

1. Design a simple T-shaped bracket in OpenSCAD and export as STL.
2. Slice it three ways and record print time and support volume for each orientation.
