# Lesson 0.5: Introduction to OpenSCAD — Part 2

**Unit:** 0 — Foundations  
**Duration:** 1–2 class periods (50–60 min each)  
**Prerequisite:** Lesson 0.4 (Part 1)

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
- Move objects using `translate()`
- Rotate objects using `rotate()`
- Combine objects using `union()`
- Create holes and subtractions using `difference()`
- Design a simple composite object (a box with a hole in it)
- Understand the concept of constructive solid geometry (CSG)

---

## Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)

OpenSCAD uses a design approach called **constructive solid geometry**. The idea is that complex shapes are made by combining, subtracting, or intersecting simple shapes.

Think of it like working with **clay** — you start with basic blocks and either add more clay (union) or carve pieces away (difference).

The three Boolean operations in OpenSCAD:

| Operation | What It Does | Analogy |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `union()` | Combines two or more shapes into one | Gluing pieces together |
| `difference()` | Subtracts one shape from another | Carving a hole |
| `intersection()` | Keeps only the overlapping region | Cookie-cutter through two shapes |

## `translate()` — Moving Objects

By default, all shapes appear at the origin (0, 0, 0). `translate()` moves a shape to a new position.

```scad
translate([x, y, z]) shape;
```

**Example: Two boxes side by side**

```scad
cube([20, 10, 5]);                    // first box at origin
translate([25, 0, 0]) cube([20, 10, 5]);  // second box, moved 25mm to the right
```

---

## `rotate()` — Rotating Objects

```scad
rotate([x_angle, y_angle, z_angle]) shape;
```

**Example: A cylinder lying on its side**

```scad
rotate([90, 0, 0]) cylinder(h = 20, r = 5);
```

---

## `union()` — Combining Shapes

```scad
union() {
    shape1;
    shape2;
}
```

---

## `difference()` — Subtracting Shapes

```scad
difference() {
    base_shape;     // the shape you start with
    hole_shape;     // the shape you remove
}
```

---

## Putting It Together: A Slotted Box

```scad
// Slotted project box
// Variables
box_l = 60;
box_w = 30;
box_h = 10;
slot_w = 20;
slot_h = 4;
wall = 3;

$fn = 40;

difference() {
    cube([box_l, box_w, box_h]);
    translate([(box_l - slot_w) / 2, -1, box_h - slot_h])
        cube([slot_w, box_w + 2, slot_h + 1]);
}
```

---

## Challenge Project

Design a simple stand or mount using only what you've learned. Use variables and at least one `difference()` hole.
