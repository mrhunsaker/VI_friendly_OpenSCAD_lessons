# Project 1 — Tactile Floor Markers

## Materials

- Failed 3D printed prototypes for examples
- Example project documentation and briefing files
- Calipers
- An environment (real or simulated) for placing floor markers

## Objectives

- Design and iterate on a tactile floor marker that meets functional requirements
- Produce technical documentation and measurement data
- Test prototypes and refine designs across iterations

## Sequence (approx. 2 weeks)

1. Read the design briefing and clarify functional requirements.
2. Sketch concepts and take measurements of target surfaces.
3. Implement a chosen design in OpenSCAD using variables for major dimensions.
4. Print prototypes, evaluate against acceptance criteria, and iterate.
5. Finalize documentation, take at least one photo of the physical device, and submit deliverables.

## Instructor notes

- Encourage multiple quick iterations with low `SHELL` settings for faster printing when testing fit.
- Emphasize documentation: students should include measured values, code, print settings, and reflections.
