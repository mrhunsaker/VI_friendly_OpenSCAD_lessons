# Unit 1: Guided Projects

**Duration:** 3–4 weeks
**Driving Question:** How do you design an object that reliably solves a specific, measurable problem?

---

## Unit Summary

Unit 1 moves students from reproducing existing objects (Project 0) to designing original ones. Students take on the role of **Operator**: they are making real design decisions, but within a clearly defined problem space. The projects in this unit have specific, pre-written functional requirements — students learn to design to a spec before they learn to write specs themselves.
