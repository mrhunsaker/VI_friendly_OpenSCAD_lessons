# CMD-0: Getting Started - Layout, Paths, and the Shell

Estimated time: 20-30 minutes

## Learning Objectives

- Launch Command Prompt and locate the prompt
- Understand path notation and shortcuts (`C:\`, `..`, `.`)
- Use tab completion to navigate quickly

## Materials

- Computer with Windows
- Editor (Notepad/VS Code)

## Step-by-step Tasks

1. Open Command Prompt and note the prompt (it includes the current path).
2. Run `cd` and say or note the printed path.
3. Use `dir /B` to list names in your home directory.
4. Practice `cd Documents`, `cd ..` and `cd \` until comfortable.
5. Try tab-completion: type `cd D` and press Tab.

## Checkpoints

- Confirm you can state your current path and move to `Documents`.

## Quiz - Lesson CMD.0

1. What is a path?
2. What does `..` mean?
3. How do you autocomplete a path?
4. How do you go up one directory?
5. What command lists only names (`dir` flag)?
6. True or False: On Windows, CMD uses backslashes (`\`) in paths, but forward slashes (`/`) are also accepted in some contexts.
7. Explain the difference between an absolute path and a relative path.
8. If you are in `C:\Users\YourName\Documents` and you type `cd ..`, where do you end up?
9. What happens when you press Tab while typing a folder name in Command Prompt?
10. Describe a practical reason why understanding paths is important for a 3D printing workflow.
11. What does `C:\` mean in a path, and when would you use it?
12. If a folder path contains spaces (e.g., `Program Files`), how do you navigate to it with `cd`?
13. Explain what the prompt `C:\Users\YourName>` tells you about your current state.
14. How would you navigate to your home directory from any location using a single command?
15. What is the advantage of using relative paths (like `..`) versus absolute paths in automation scripts?

## Extension Problems

1. Create a nested folder and practice `cd` into it by typing partial names and using Tab.
2. Use `dir /B /A:F` to list only files in a folder.
3. Save `cd` output (the path) to a file and open it in Notepad.
4. Try `cd` into a folder whose name contains spaces; observe how quotes are handled.
5. Create a short note file and open it from Command Prompt.
6. Build a folder structure that mirrors your project organization; navigate to each level and document the path.
7. Use `echo %cd%` to print your current path and save it to a file.
8. Investigate special paths (e.g., `%USERPROFILE%`, `%TEMP%`); write down what each contains and when you'd use them.
9. Compare absolute vs. relative paths by navigating to the same folder using each method; explain which is easier for automation.
10. Create a batch file that changes to a frequently-used folder and lists its contents in one command; test it from different starting locations.
11. Navigate to three different locations and at each one note the prompt, the path from `cd`, and verify you understand what each shows.
12. Create a complex folder tree (at least 5 levels deep) and navigate it using only relative paths; verify your location at each step.
13. Document all path shortcuts you know (`C:\`, `..`, `.`) and demonstrate each one works as expected.
14. Write a guide for a peer on how to understand the Command Prompt and path notation without using GUI file explorer.
15. Create a troubleshooting flowchart: if someone says "I don't know where I am," what commands do you give them to find out?
