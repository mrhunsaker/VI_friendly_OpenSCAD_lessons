# Windows Command Line {#cmd_foundation-part_1}

This section covers terminal fundamentals, screen reader accessibility, and command-line basics needed before diving into 3D design with OpenSCAD. This is an alternate pathway to the PowerShell curriculum, using Windows Command Prompt (CMD) instead.

Time commitment: ~10 hours  
Skills gained: Terminal navigation, file operations, basic scripting, keyboard-only workflow mastery  

> [!NOTE]
> CMD is simpler than PowerShell but has fewer advanced features. Both pathways teach the same fundamental concepts.
