## Getting Started with Screen Readers {#getting-started}

### Which Screen Reader Should I Use?

Both NVDA and JAWS work with CMD; NVDA is free and often easiest to start with. JAWS provides advanced features for power users. Dolphin SuperNova and Windows Narrator are also options:

- Dolphin SuperNova: commercial speech, braille, and magnification (use vendor docs for key mappings).
- Windows Narrator: built into Windows for quick, no-install access.

### Before You Start

1. Start your screen reader before opening CMD.
2. Open Command Prompt and listen for the window title and prompt.
3. If silent, press Alt+Tab to find the window.

### What is CMD?

CMD (Command Prompt) is the classic Windows shell. Common commands include `dir`, `type`, and `more`. Paths use backslashes (e.g., `C:\Users\You`).

## NVDA-Specific Tips {#nvda-tips}

NVDA is available from [https://www.nvaccess.org/](https://www.nvaccess.org/)

### Dolphin SuperNova

Dolphin SuperNova: [https://yourdolphin.com/supernova/](https://yourdolphin.com/supernova/) — commercial screen reader and magnifier; check institutional licensing.

### Windows Narrator

Windows Narrator: [https://support.microsoft.com/narrator](https://support.microsoft.com/narrator) — built-in, simpler command set; useful when third-party readers are unavailable.

### Key Commands for CMD

| Command         | What It Does                                          |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| NVDA+Home       | Read the current line (your command or output)        |
| NVDA+Down Arrow | Read from cursor to end of screen                     |
| NVDA+Up Arrow   | Read from top to cursor                               |
| NVDA+Page Down  | Read next page                                        |
| NVDA+Page Up    | Read previous page                                    |
| NVDA+F7         | Open the Review Mode viewer (can scroll through text) |

### Example: Reading Long Output

If `dir` produces many lines, redirect to a file and open it in Notepad:

```cmd
dir /b > list.txt
notepad list.txt
```

`dir /b` shows one item per line (screen reader friendly).

## JAWS-Specific Tips {#jaws-tips}

JAWS is available from [https://www.freedomscientific.com/](https://www.freedomscientific.com/)

### Key Commands for CMD

| Command           | What It Does               |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Insert+Down Arrow | Read line by line downward |
| Insert+Up Arrow   | Read line by line upward   |
| Insert+Page Down  | Read next page of text     |
| Insert+Page Up    | Read previous page of text |

### Example: Reading Long Output

1. Redirect: `dir /b > list.txt`
2. Open Notepad: `notepad list.txt`
3. Use Insert+Ctrl+Down to read full contents.

## General Terminal Accessibility {#general-terminal}

### Understanding the CMD Layout

The Command Prompt window shows a title bar, a content area, and the prompt (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName>`).

### The CMD Prompt

Example:

```plaintext
C:\Users\YourName>
```

### Navigation Sequence

1. Screen reader announces the title
2. Then it announces the prompt line
3. Anything above prompt is prior output

## Working with Long Output {#long-output}

### Solution 1: Redirect to a File

```cmd
dir /b > list.txt
notepad list.txt
```

### Solution 2: Use Pagination

```cmd
type largefile.txt | more
```

Use Space for next page and Q to quit.

### Solution 3: Filter Output

```cmd
dir /b | findstr /R "\.scad$"
```

### Solution 4: Count Before Displaying

```cmd
dir /b | find /v "" /c
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts Reference {#shortcuts}

| Key        | Action                          |
|------------|---------------------------------|
| Up Arrow   | Show previous command           |
| Down Arrow | Show next command               |
