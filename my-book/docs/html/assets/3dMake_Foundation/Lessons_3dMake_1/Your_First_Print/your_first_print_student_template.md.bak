- Description: Select a simple 3D model, configure slicer settings, and complete your first independent print job.

## Ideas and Concept

### Model Selection

- Model name and source (Thingiverse, Printables, etc.):
- Link or file reference:
- Why did you choose this model?

### Printability Assessment

- Estimated print time (from slicer):
- Estimated filament:
- Expected challenges (overhangs, thin features, supports needed):
- Why is this model appropriate for a first print?

## Measurements and Printer Configuration

### Printer Setup Log

| Parameter          | Value |
|--------------------|-------|
| Printer model      |       |
| Nozzle diameter    |       |
| Bed temperature    |       |
| Nozzle temperature |       |
| Layer height       |       |
| Infill percentage  |       |
| Support settings   |       |

### Safety Checks (Completed)

- [ ] Bed clean and level
- [ ] Bed adhesive/prep applied (if needed)
- [ ] Filament loaded correctly
- [ ] Nozzle at correct height
- [ ] Print area clear of obstructions
- [ ] Buildplate secured

## Object Notes

### Print Monitoring Notes

- What did you observe in the first 10 minutes?
- Any adhesion issues?
- Any extrusion problems?
- Print completed successfully: Yes / No

### Printed Part Measurements (After Cooling)

| Feature | Model Spec (mm) | Printed (mm) | Deviation | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|-------|
|         |                 |              |           |       |
|         |                 |              |           |       |
|         |                 |              |           |       |

### Use and Assembly Notes

- How does the print feel and look compared to the model?
- Did any features fail or print poorly?
- If there were issues, what do you suspect caused them?

## Reflections

### What Went Well
- Which aspect of the print was most successful?
- Did anything surprise you positively?

### What Didn't Go Well
- Were there any defects or failed features?
- What challenges did you encounter?

### Learning and Next Steps
- What did you learn from this first independent print?
- What would you do differently next time?
- If you printed this again, what settings would you change?

### Post-Print Analysis

- Compare this print to others you've seen in the classroom
- What variables (temperature, layer height, infill) do you think most affected the outcome?
- How would you test that hypothesis?
