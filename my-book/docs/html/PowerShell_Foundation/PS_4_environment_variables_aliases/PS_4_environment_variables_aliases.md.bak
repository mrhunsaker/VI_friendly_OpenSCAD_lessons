# PS-4: Environment Variables, PATH, and Aliases  {#powershell_foundation_ps_4_environment_variables_aliases-ps_4_environment_variables_aliases}

Estimated time: 30-45 minutes

Learning Objectives
- Read environment variables with `$env:VARNAME`
- Inspect and verify programs in the `PATH`
- Create temporary aliases and understand making them persistent via the profile

Materials
- PowerShell (with rights to open profile if desired)

Step-by-step Tasks
1. Show your username and home path with `echo $env:USERNAME` and `echo $env:USERPROFILE`.
2. Inspect `echo $env:PATH` and identify whether `openscad` or `code` would be found.
3. Run `Get-Command openscad` and note the result.
4. Create a temporary alias: `Set-Alias -Name preview -Value openscad` and test `preview myfile.scad`.
5. Open your profile (`notepad.exe $PROFILE`) and add the alias line to make it persistent (advanced).

Checkpoints
- After step 3 you can determine whether a program will be found by `PATH`.

## Quiz - Lesson PS.4

1. How do you print an environment variable?
2. What is the purpose of `PATH`?
3. How do you check whether `openscad` is available?
4. How do you create a temporary alias?
5. Where would you make an alias permanent?
6. True or False: Environment variables are case-sensitive on all platforms.
7. Explain why having a program in your PATH is useful compared to always using its full file path.
8. Write a command that would create an alias called `slicer` for the OpenSCAD executable.
9. What file would you edit to make an alias persist across PowerShell sessions?
10. Describe a practical benefit of using the `$env:TEMP` directory for temporary files in a 3D printing workflow.
11. You have a custom script at `C:\Scripts\backup_models.ps1` that you want to run from anywhere as `backup-now`. What steps would you take to make this work?
12. Explain the difference between setting an environment variable in the current session vs. adding it to your profile for permanence.
13. Design a profile strategy for managing multiple 3D printing projects, each with different tool paths and directories; show how to structure environment variables for each.
14. If a program is not found by `Get-Command`, what are the possible reasons, and how would you troubleshoot?
15. Describe how you would verify that your PowerShell profile is loading correctly and how to debug issues if aliases or environment variables don't appear after restarting PowerShell.

## Extension Problems
1. Add a folder to PATH for a test program (describe steps; do not change system PATH without admin).
2. Create a short profile snippet that sets two aliases and test re-opening PowerShell.
3. Use `Get-Command` to list the path for several common programs.
4. Explore `$env:TEMP` and create a file there.
5. Save a copy of your current PATH to a text file and examine it in your editor.
6. Create a PowerShell profile script that loads custom aliases and environment variables for your 3D printing workflow; test it in a new session.
7. Build a "project profile" that sets environment variables for CAD, slicing, and print directories; switch between profiles for different projects.
8. Write a script that audits your current environment variables and creates a summary report of what's set and why.
9. Design a custom alias system for common 3D printing commands; document the aliases and their purposes.
10. Create a profile migration guide: document how to export and import your PowerShell profile across machines for consistent workflows.
11. Implement a safe PATH modification script: create a utility that allows you to add/remove directories from PATH for the current session only; show how to make it permanent in your profile.
12. Build a comprehensive profile framework with modules: create separate .ps1 files for aliases, environment variables, and functions; have your main profile load all of them dynamically.
13. Develop an environment validation tool: write a script that checks whether all required programs (OpenSCAD, slicers, etc.) are accessible via PATH; report findings and suggest fixes.
14. Create a project-switching alias system: design a function that changes all environment variables and aliases based on the current project; test switching between multiple projects.
15. Build a profile troubleshooting guide: create a script that exports your current environment state (variables, aliases, PATH) to a timestamped file, allowing you to compare states before and after changes and identify what broke.
