# Introduction {#readme}

This course teaches 3D design and digital fabrication using a fully accessible, command-line-driven toolchain centered on OpenSCAD (text-based CAD), 3DMake (non-visual build automation), and accessible editors (VS Code, Notepad++, command-line editors) with screen reader support.

The curriculum is explicitly designed for blind and visually impaired learners who use screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver). It eliminates GUI navigation and visual feedback in favor of keyboard-driven, text-based workflows that screen readers can fully access. Accessibility is not an add-on. It is the foundation of every tool, workflow, and lesson in this curriculum.

## Curriculum Structure

### Screen Reader Setup & Accessibility Fundamentals

Before choosing a command-line pathway, students learn to optimize their screen reader setup for terminal work and understand accessibility options.

What's Included:

- [Screen Reader Accessibility Guide](Setup/Screen_Reader_Accessibility_Guide/Screen_Reader_Accessibility_Guide.md) - Comprehensive NVDA & JAWS reference with terminal tips for PowerShell, CMD, and Git Bash
- [Screen Reader Choice: Windows CLI](Setup/Screen_Reader_Choice/Screen_Reader_Choice.md) - Help choosing between NVDA and JAWS
- [Braille Display & Terminal Mode](Setup/Braille_Displays/Braille_Displays.md) - Advanced accessibility setup with refreshable braille displays
- [Editor Selection and Setup](Setup/Editor_Selection_Setup/Editor_Selection_Setup.md) - Choosing and configuring an accessible text editor

Why start here? Screen reader optimization is the foundation for all command-line work. Students learn keyboard shortcuts, navigation techniques, and terminal-specific accessibility before diving into any CLI pathway.

## The Accessible Toolchain

### Screen Reader Compatibility Throughout

This course uses tools designed for screen reader access:

- Terminal/Command line - Text-based, fully accessible to NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver
- OpenSCAD - Free, open-source text-based CAD (no visual-only GUI dependency)
- 3DMake - Command-line build tool eliminating GUI navigation
- Accessible editors - VS Code, Notepad++, Nano, Vim (all keyboard-driven, screen reader friendly)

See [Screen Reader Coding Tips (NVDA & JAWS)](3dMake_Foundation/Lessons_3dMake_1/nvda-jaws-coding-tips.md) for detailed keyboard shortcuts and configuration.

### 3DMake: Non-Visual Build Automation

3DMake makes the entire design-to-print pipeline accessible:

```bash
3dm build        -> Compiles main.scad to main.stl
3dm info         -> Validates geometry and runs diagnostics
3dm slice        -> Prepares model for printing
```

- No GUI navigation needed
- Automation eliminates repetitive manual steps
- Configuration files store parameters as human-readable text
- Error reporting is text-based (screen reader accessible)
- Works with command-line slicers

### Iterative, Non-Visual Design

Students learn to design through code and testing, not visual previews:

- Write parametric OpenSCAD code in accessible editors
- Run `3dm build` to compile to printable file
- Use measurement-based verification (calipers, scales, functional testing)
- Iterate by editing parameters and rebuilding
- No reliance on 3D preview or visual feedback

## Project-Based Learning

Every 3dMake lesson includes hands-on projects:

- Lesson 6: Keycap with embossed text (3dm commands)
- Lesson 7: Phone stand (parametric transforms)
- Lesson 8: Stackable bins (interlocking features, tolerances)
- Lesson 9: Keychain automation (PowerShell batch processing)
- Lesson 10: QA testing + accessibility audit (measurement, troubleshooting)
- Lesson 11: Beaded jewelry holder (stakeholder-driven design)

Each project requires:

- Parametric OpenSCAD code (clean, well-commented)
- Functional prototype (tested, iterated)
- Complete documentation (reflections, measurements, decisions)
