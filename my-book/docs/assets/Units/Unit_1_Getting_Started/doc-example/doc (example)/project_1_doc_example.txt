Object Notes
- Will need a description of there design including design choices made
- Include constraints observed
- Include functional requirements and notes on them
- Description of material and 3d printer settings


Example:
I designed my object to fit a command strip perfectly. I wanted to make a tactile marker that was able to be noticeable by students and staff at TSBVI and that could be removable if need be. I also wanted to make it so furniture would easily roll over the markers if need be, without destroying them. I had to design the object in openSCAD and use the 3D printer. The object is made out of PLA plastic and was printed with 20% infill and a .3mm layer height with generic PLA settings.

Measurements (These are mine you will need to plan and measure your own)
Desired X length =  70
Desired Y length = 16
Desired Z length = 5
Command strip X length = 70 
Command strip Y length = 16


Reflections Example (Do not just feel in the blanks here... write your own thought out reflections)
- What did you try and what worked and did not work
- What could you have done better
I could have done ___ better after testing against the functional requirements I noticed ____ and that I should have changed _____ in my design. Next time I would do ____ and ___
