# Lesson 2: Geometric Primitives and Constructive Solid Geometry (Self-Paced)

Estimated time: 60 minutes

**Learning Objectives**
- Use OpenSCAD primitives (`cube()`, `sphere()`, `cylinder()`) and transforms (`translate()`, `rotate()`, `scale()`)
- Apply CSG operators (`union`, `difference`, `intersection`) safely and diagnose common numerical issues
- Use quick diagnostic renders and validate geometry in a slicer

**Materials**
- 3dMake project scaffold with `src/main.scad`
- Example primitive snippets (provided in assets)

Step-by-step Tasks
1. Open `src/main.scad`; identify and run simple examples using `cube()`, `sphere()`, and `cylinder()`.
2. Create three short examples demonstrating `union()`, `difference()`, and `intersection()` and render with reduced `$fn`.
3. Reproduce a failing `difference()` case and apply the 0.001 offset strategy to the subtractor; re-render and confirm fix.
4. Build an STL with `3dm build` and open it in your slicer to check for thin walls or islands.
5. Document any fixes in the project README and commit the working `main.scad` and STL.

Checkpoints
- After task 3 the problematic boolean should render without non-manifold warnings.

Quick Quiz (5)
1. Name three primitive functions in OpenSCAD.
2. What does `difference()` accomplish?
3. Why might two coincident faces cause a render failure?
4. What is the 0.001 rule and why is it useful?
5. How does lowering `$fn` help during debugging?

Extension Problems (5)
1. Create a small assembly using `union()` of three primitives and export the STL.
2. Intentionally create a failing boolean and fix it using offsets; explain your approach.
3. Write a short test script that generates three variants with varying `$fn` values and compare render times.
4. Use `3dm info` (if available) to generate a report on your model and document any recommendations.
5. Explore using a library module (e.g., a fillet helper) to fix a sharp corner and note the difference in final STL.
