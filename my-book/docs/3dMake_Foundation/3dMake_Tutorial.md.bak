# 3dmake: Non-Visual 3D Printing Tutorial (Self-Paced)

Estimated time: 45–75 minutes

**Learning Objectives**
- Describe the 3dMake command-line workflow and project structure
- Create a new 3dMake project, edit `src/main.scad`, and run `3dm build`
- Slice a model and produce a tactile preview or full G-code

**Materials**
- Computer with 3dMake installed
- Screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, Orca) configured
- Example project files in `assets/` or classroom repo

Step-by-step Tasks
1. Verify prerequisites: confirm `3dm`, `openscad`, and your slicer are discoverable in the terminal (`which 3dm`, `which openscad`).
2. Create a new project: `3dm new` → open `src/main.scad` with `3dm edit-model` and add a simple cube: `cube([20,20,20]);`.
3. Build the project: `3dm build` and confirm `build/main.stl` exists.
4. Slice a preview: `3dm preview slice` then `3dm preview print` (or export preview STL) to test tactile output.
5. Slice for full print: `3dm build slice` → inspect `build/main.gcode` with a layer-preview option in your slicer.

Checkpoints
- After step 2 you can open and edit `src/main.scad` from the terminal.
- After step 3 the `build/` folder contains `main.stl`.

Quick Quiz (5)
1. What command creates a new 3dMake project?
2. Where does 3dMake put compiled STLs by default?
3. How do you open the model editor from the CLI?
4. What command slices a preview for tactile testing?
5. Why is it useful to run a preview before a full print?

Extension Problems (5)
1. Create two variants of a parameterized cube (different sizes) and export both STLs; compare their file sizes and estimated print times.
2. Add a `3dmake.toml` overlay that changes layer height and document the visible effect on the preview.
3. Build and slice a small object, then import the STL into a second slicer and report any differences in estimated time.
4. Create a short shell script that automates new → edit → build for a classroom scaffold.
5. Describe three safety checks you will perform before starting a multi-hour print.

Notes: This lesson is intended to be hands-on. If networked AI features are not configured, skip the AI verification steps and focus on deterministic renders and slicer previews.
