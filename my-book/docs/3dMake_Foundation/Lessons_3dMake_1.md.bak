# Lesson 1: Environmental Configuration and the Developer Workflow (Self-Paced)

Estimated time: 60–90 minutes

**Learning Objectives**
- Install and verify `3dm`, `openscad`, and a slicer are discoverable in the terminal
- Initialize a 3dMake project and understand the project scaffold (`src/`, `build/`, `3dmake.toml`)
- Edit `src/main.scad`, run `3dm build`, and inspect the generated `build/main.stl`

**Materials**
- Terminal with 3dMake installed
- Editor (VS Code or Notepad)
- Example scaffold or classroom repository

---

Step-by-step Tasks
1. Run `./3dm setup` or follow instructor's installation notes; confirm tools with `which 3dm` and `which openscad`.
2. Create a project scaffold with `3dm new` and open `src/main.scad` using `3dm edit-model`.
3. Add three top-level parameters (e.g., `width`, `height`, `thickness`) and a minimal model (`cube([width, height, thickness]);`).
4. Run `3dm build` and verify `build/main.stl` exists.
5. Open the STL in your slicer to check for thin walls or non-manifold geometry; if issues appear, iterate on `main.scad` and rebuild.

Checkpoints
- After step 2 you can locate `3dmake.toml` and the `build/` directory.
- After step 4 the `build/` folder contains a valid `main.stl`.

Quick Quiz (5)
1. What command initializes a 3dMake project?
2. What folder holds generated STLs?
3. How do you open the main model editor from the CLI?
4. Why is it useful to run `3dm build` frequently during development?
5. Give one reason to prefer an external editor over editing inline.

Extension Problems (5)
1. Add a README entry explaining your top-level parameters and expected units.
2. Create a parameter variant by changing `width` by 20% and build both variants; compare dimensions with calipers.
3. Script a `3dm` command sequence that automates new → edit → build for the scaffold.
4. Intentionally create a thin-wall error and document the steps you took to find and fix it.
5. Prepare a short instructor sign-off checklist describing safety checks before printing.
