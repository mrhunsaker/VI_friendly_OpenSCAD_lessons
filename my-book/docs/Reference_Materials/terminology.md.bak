# Terminology

**Accessibility:** When including images or diagrams, add short alt-text and provide a comment-based walkthrough for any .scad examples so screen-reader users can follow the design steps.


## How to Use This Terminology File

- Review the glossary before lessons that reference terms (e.g., the
  OpenSCAD lessons, Make3D build walkthroughs, and PowerShell guides).
- Encourage students to keep a personal glossary when they encounter
  new words during projects and prototyping.
- Maintain and extend this file as new tools or workflows are adopted.

## General Terms
Shape - Any graphical 2D or 3D object created by OpenSCAD.
Design - An OpenSCAD creation (an OpenSCAD program) which usually
  consists of a combination of multiple shapes and operations.
Operation - An OpenSCAD command that changes the appearance or
  properties of one or more shapes (for example translate(), rotate(),
  difference(), union()).
Parameter - A named value passed into a module, function, or used as a
  variable to control dimensions and behavior.
Preview - A fast, approximate display of a design in OpenSCAD used for
  checking structure before full render.
Render - Full evaluation of a design's geometry in OpenSCAD; required
  before exporting to an STL for printing.
Units - The measurement units used in designs. OpenSCAD is unitless by
  default, but in 3D printing contexts millimeters are conventionally
  used; be explicit about units when sharing models.
Width / Length / Height - X, Y, and Z axis dimensions respectively.
2D shape - A planar geometry with width and length but negligible
  height (e.g., a 2D profile used for extrusion).
3D shape - A solid geometry with width, length, and height.

## 3D Printing Terminology

Layer Height - The vertical thickness of each printed layer, typically
  measured in millimeters; smaller values give finer Z resolution.
Nozzle (Extruder) - The heated tip on the printer that melts filament
  and deposits it onto the print surface.
Filament - Thermoplastic material supplied as a long strand (e.g., PLA,
  PETG, ABS, TPU) used by FDM printers.
Infill - The internal lattice or pattern printed inside a solid object to
  provide strength while saving material; expressed as a percentage.
Shell (Wall) - The outer perimeters printed around each layer that form
  the visible surface and structural walls of a part.
Brim / Raft / Skirt - Temporary structures printed to improve bed
  adhesion or prime the extruder; removed after printing.
Retraction - A printer motion that withdraws filament to reduce ooze
  when moving between print areas.
Overhang - A portion of a model that extends outward such that it has
  little or no support underneath; critical for printability.
Support - Additional printed material used to hold up overhangs during
  printing; removed after printing (manually or dissolvable).
Bed Adhesion - Methods and materials used to keep the first layer
  attached to the build plate (tape, glue stick, PEI, heated bed).
Print Speed - The rate at which the printer moves while extruding;
  faster speeds reduce time but can reduce print quality.
Layer Cooling - Use of fans to cool freshly extruded plastic; affects
  bridging and overhang quality.
G-code - The low-level instructions sent to a 3D printer describing
  moves, extrusion, temperatures, and other commands.
STL - A common 3D model file format (surface tessellation) used for
  3D printing; does not hold scale or unit metadata.
Slicing - The process of converting a 3D model (e.g., STL) into per-layer
  toolpaths and G-code for a specific printer and filament.
Print Bed / Build Plate - The surface on which prints are produced.
Warping - Distortion caused by uneven cooling, often lifting corners
  from the build plate; mitigated by bed adhesion and enclosure.
Calibration - The process of adjusting printer settings (e.g., steps/mm,
  nozzle height) to ensure accurate prints.

## OpenSCAD-Specific Terms

Module - A reusable block of OpenSCAD code defined with `module name(){}`
  which can be called with different parameters to produce geometry.
Function - A small, parameterized computation defined with `function`
  that returns a value used in modules or expressions.
Boolean Operations - `union()`, `difference()`, `intersection()` used to
  combine or subtract solids.
Transform - Operations that change object position or orientation,
  including `translate()`, `rotate()`, and `scale()`.
Children - In module calls, the nested code that becomes part of the
  module's execution context when using `children()`.
CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) - The technique of building complex
  shapes by combining primitive solids with boolean operations.
Primitive - Simple built-in shapes like `cube()`, `cylinder()`,
  `sphere()`, and `polyhedron()`.
Linear Extrusion - `linear_extrude()` which creates a 3D shape from
  a 2D profile by extruding along the Z axis.
Rotate_extrude - `rotate_extrude()` which sweeps a 2D profile around
  an axis to form rotationally symmetric solids.
Children() - A special OpenSCAD construct that allows a module to
  render nested content passed into it.
Preview vs Render - Preview is quick and approximate; render (`F6`)
  evaluates the final geometry for export.
Parameterization - Designing with variables and parameters so that a
  single file can generate many variants by changing inputs.

## 3dMake / Make3D Terminology (CLI-based toolchain concepts)

3dMake (Make3D) - A command-line workflow or helper scripts that
  automate building, slicing, and managing OpenSCAD-based projects.
Build Script - A script that automates repetitive steps (rendering,
  slicing, packaging) for reproducible builds.
Pipeline - The sequence of steps from source (.scad) to final G-code
  (render -> export STL -> slice -> generate G-code).
Artifacts - Files produced by the build pipeline (STL, G-code, logs).
Parameter File - External file (JSON, TOML, or similar) that provides
  default parameter values to feed into OpenSCAD builds.
Headless Render - Running OpenSCAD from the command line (no GUI)
  to render models and export STLs programmatically.
Automation - Using scripts or CI to produce builds and test changes
  without manual GUI interaction.

## PowerShell Terminology (relevant to automation and workflows)

PowerShell - A task automation and configuration management framework
  from Microsoft that uses cmdlets and a scripting language.
Cmdlet - A lightweight command in PowerShell (e.g., `Get-ChildItem`,
  `Set-ExecutionPolicy`) with structured input and output.
Script - A `.ps1` file containing PowerShell commands, functions, and
  logic used to automate tasks.
Module (PowerShell) - A package of functions, cmdlets, or scripts that
  can be imported with `Import-Module`.
Pipeline (PowerShell) - Passing the output of one cmdlet as the input
  to another using the `|` operator for chained processing.
Object - PowerShell passes rich objects (not plain text) between
  commands, enabling structured data manipulation.
PSProvider - A PowerShell interface that exposes data stores as drives
  (e.g., `HKLM:`, `Variable:`), enabling uniform access.
Execution Policy - Security setting controlling whether scripts can
  run on a machine (e.g., `Restricted`, `RemoteSigned`).
Cmdlet Parameters - Named options passed to cmdlets (e.g., `-Path`,
  `-Recurse`) to customize behavior.
Remote Session - Using `Enter-PSSession` or `Invoke-Command` to run
  commands on a remote system.
Error Handling - Using `try{ } catch { } finally { }` and `$Error`
  variables to handle script failures gracefully.
Splatting - Passing a collection of parameters to a cmdlet using `@{}`
  or `@array` for cleaner code.
Format-Table / Format-List - Cmdlets for controlling how objects are
  displayed in the console; for automation prefer raw objects to
  formatted text.

## Testing, Documentation, and Workflow Terms

Linting - Static analysis to detect style or simple errors in code
  (e.g., PowerShell Script Analyzer).
Unit / Integration Test - Automated checks that verify functions or
  the build pipeline produce expected outputs.
Versioning - Tracking changes to files (git) to manage collaboration
  and releases.
Release Assets - Packaged files attached to a release (useful for
  distributing large binaries or fonts without committing them to the
  repository).
Accessibility (a11y) - Ensuring materials and workflows work for
  people using assistive technology (screen readers, braille displays,
  keyboard navigation).
