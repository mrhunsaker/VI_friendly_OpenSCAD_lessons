# Master Project Rubric — 0–9 Point Scale

**Accessibility:** When including images or diagrams, add short alt-text and provide a comment-based walkthrough for any .scad examples so screen-reader users can follow the design steps.


*This rubric applies to all Unit 1, 2, and 3 projects unless otherwise noted in the project briefing. Project 0 is complete/incomplete only.*

## Rubric Overview

Projects are scored from 0–9 across three categories worth 3 points each:

| Category | Max Points | What Is Evaluated |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Problem & Solution** | 3 | How well the prototype meets the identified problem or functional requirements |
| **Design Quality** | 3 | Complexity, originality, technical quality of the design; evidence of iteration |
| **Documentation** | 3 | Completeness, accuracy, and thoughtfulness of all written deliverables |

---

## Category 1: Problem & Solution (0–3 points)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **3** | The prototype clearly and effectively solves the stated problem. All functional requirements are met. The solution shows evidence of testing against the requirements. |
| **2** | The prototype mostly meets the problem. Most functional requirements are met. Minor gaps between the design and the requirements. |
| **1** | The prototype partially addresses the problem. Several functional requirements are not met or were not clearly tested. |
| **0** | The prototype does not address the stated problem, or no functional requirements were established. |

---

## Category 2: Design Quality (0–3 points)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **3** | The design is original, well-considered, and technically executed. Code (if applicable) is clean, uses variables/modules appropriately, and is well-commented. The print is clean and well-made. Evidence of at least one meaningful revision or iteration. |
| **2** | The design is functional and shows thought. Code works but may lack structure (few comments, raw numbers instead of variables). Print quality is acceptable. Some iteration evident. |
| **1** | The design is basic or primarily borrowed from another source without modification. Code has issues. Print quality has significant defects that were not addressed. |
| **0** | No meaningful original design. Print is not functional or was not completed. |

---

## Category 3: Documentation (0–3 points)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **3** | All required sections are present, complete, and specific. Reflections are thoughtful and reference specific decisions, problems encountered, and learning. Photos are included. Measurements are recorded. |
| **2** | Most required sections are present. Some sections are vague or missing detail. Reflections show some thought but are brief or generic. |
| **1** | Documentation is incomplete. Major sections are missing or consist of one-line responses. Reflections are minimal. |
| **0** | Documentation is not submitted or is essentially empty. |

## Score Interpretation

| Total Score | Interpretation | Next Step |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| 8–9 | Excellent work | Move on to next project |
| 6–7 | Good work with room for improvement | Move on; instructor may suggest revisiting one element |
| 4–5 | Meets basic expectations | Resubmission of specific weak areas recommended |
| 2–3 | Does not meet expectations | Resubmission required |
| 0–1 | Missing major deliverables | Meet with instructor; create a completion plan |

---

## Notes for Specific Projects

- **Project 0:** Complete / Incomplete only. No 0–9 scale.
- **Project 2:** Stakeholder sign-off is required. A missing sign-off automatically limits the Problem & Solution score to a maximum of 2.
- **Project 4:** Both stakeholder interviews must be documented. Missing interviews limit the Problem & Solution score to a maximum of 1.

---

## Resubmission Policy

Students may resubmit any project once to improve their score. Resubmissions must include:
1. The original submission
2. A one-paragraph explanation of what was changed and why

The resubmission score replaces the original score.
