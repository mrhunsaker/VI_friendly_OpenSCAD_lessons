# Screen Reader Coding Tips — NVDA & JAWS

**Accessibility:** When including images or diagrams, add short alt-text and provide a comment-based walkthrough for any .scad examples so screen-reader users can follow the design steps.


*A consolidated reference for using NVDA or JAWS while writing OpenSCAD code in VSCode or Notepad++. Tips that were previously scattered across lesson files are collected here.*

## General Principles for Coding with a Screen Reader

- **Turn punctuation up.** All OpenSCAD syntax — semicolons, brackets, parentheses, commas — is meaningful. If your screen reader skips punctuation, you will miss syntax errors. Set punctuation to **Most** or **All** before coding.
- **Navigate by line.** Arrow up and down to move through code one line at a time. Use `Ctrl + Left/Right` to move word by word within a line.
- **Use go-to-line.** Both VSCode and Notepad++ let you jump to a specific line number with `Ctrl + G`. OpenSCAD errors always give a line number — use this to find them fast.
- **Spell when uncertain.** If you are not sure what a character is, spell the line character by character using your screen reader's spell command.
- **Comment as you go.** Adding a short comment after a block of code lets you navigate by searching for recognizable words with `Ctrl + F`.

## NVDA Quick Reference

### Setting Punctuation Level
`NVDA + P` — cycles through: None → Some → Most → All

For code: set to **Most** or **All**.

You can also set a permanent default:
`NVDA + N` → Preferences → Settings → Speech → Symbol level

### Essential Reading Commands

| Action | Keys |
|--------|------|
| Read current line | `NVDA + Up Arrow` |
| Spell current line | `NVDA + Up Arrow` (twice quickly) |
| Read from cursor to end | `NVDA + Down Arrow` |
| Read current word | `NVDA + Numpad 5` |
| Spell current word | `NVDA + Numpad 5` (twice quickly) |
| Read current character | `NVDA + Numpad 2` |
| Stop reading | `Ctrl` |

### Navigation in VSCode with NVDA

| Action | Keys |
|--------|------|
| Move by character | `Left / Right Arrow` |
| Move by word | `Ctrl + Left / Right Arrow` |
| Move by line | `Up / Down Arrow` |
| Start / end of line | `Home / End` |
| Start / end of file | `Ctrl + Home / Ctrl + End` |
| Go to line number | `Ctrl + G`, type number, `Enter` |
| Find text | `Ctrl + F` |
| Toggle line comment | `Ctrl + /` |

### If NVDA Stops Reading the Editor

1. Click in the editor area once with the mouse (or press `Escape` and then click)
2. Press `NVDA + Space` to toggle between Browse and Application mode — for code editors, you want Application mode

## JAWS Quick Reference

### Setting Punctuation Level
`JAWS Key + Shift + 2` — cycles through punctuation levels

For code: set to **All**.

### Essential Reading Commands

| Action | Keys |
|--------|------|
| Read current line | `JAWS Key + Up Arrow` |
| Spell current line | `JAWS Key + Up Arrow` (twice quickly) |
| Read from cursor | `JAWS Key + A` |
| Read current word | `JAWS Key + Numpad 5` |
| Read next word | `JAWS Key + Right Arrow` |
| Read current character | `JAWS Key + Numpad 5` (once = word, twice = spell) |
| Stop reading | `Ctrl` |

### Adjusting Speech Rate

| Action | Keys |
|--------|------|
| Increase rate | `Alt + Ctrl + Page Up` (or `Fn + Up Arrow` on laptops) |
| Decrease rate | `Alt + Ctrl + Page Down` (or `Fn + Down Arrow` on laptops) |

### Navigation in VSCode with JAWS

| Action | Keys |
|--------|------|
| Move by character | `Left / Right Arrow` |
| Move by word | `Ctrl + Left / Right Arrow` |
| Move by line | `Up / Down Arrow` |
| Start / end of line | `Home / End` |
| Start / end of file | `Ctrl + Home / Ctrl + End` |
| Go to line number | `Ctrl + G` |
| Find text | `Ctrl + F` |
| Toggle line comment | `Ctrl + /` |

### If JAWS Stops Reading the Editor

1. Press `JAWS Key + Z` to toggle Virtual/Browse mode off — for VSCode you want Virtual mode **off**
2. Focus the menu bar with `Alt`, then press `Escape` to return to the editor
3. If still not working, press `Alt + F4` to close VSCode and reopen it

### Window Focus

When you launch OpenSCAD from VSCode (via the task runner), focus stays in VSCode. To switch to OpenSCAD to read the console or error messages:

- `Alt + Tab` to cycle through open windows
- JAWS will announce the application name as you cycle

## OpenSCAD-Specific Tips

### Reading Errors

When OpenSCAD can't render your code, it outputs an error. The error message always includes:
- **Line number** — use `Ctrl + G` in VSCode to jump there
- **Error type** — usually a missing semicolon, a typo in a command name, or mismatched brackets

Common errors and what they sound like:

| Error message | What it usually means |
|--------------|----------------------|
| "Expected ';' ..." | You forgot a semicolon at the end of a statement |
| "Expected ',' or ')' ..." | Missing comma between parameters, or unclosed parenthesis |
| "Identifier ... is undefined" | You typed a variable name wrong, or used a variable before declaring it |
| "WARNING: Normalized tree is empty" | Your shape has no geometry (e.g., you subtracted more than you started with) |

### Bracket Matching

All OpenSCAD shapes and operations use brackets and braces:
- Parentheses `()` — hold parameters: `cube([10, 10, 10])`
- Square brackets `[]` — hold vectors (lists of numbers): `[10, 10, 10]`
- Curly braces `{}` — hold groups of shapes for boolean operations

Every opening bracket must have a closing bracket. If you are missing one, OpenSCAD will report an error somewhere near (but not always exactly at) the problem.

VSCode can help: when your cursor is on a bracket, VSCode highlights the matching bracket. With NVDA, you can navigate to the matching bracket with `Ctrl + Shift + \`.

### Commenting Out Code

To test part of your code without deleting it, comment it out:

- Single line: position cursor at start of line, type `//`
- Multiple lines: select the lines, press `Ctrl + /` in VSCode (adds `//` to each selected line)
- Block comment: type `/*` before and `*/` after the block

To uncomment: select the commented lines, press `Ctrl + /` again.

### Navigating Large Files

Use `Ctrl + F` (Find) to locate sections of your code:
- Search for your module names to jump to them: e.g., `module round_bead`
- Search for comments you wrote: e.g., `// Step 2`
- Search for line numbers in error messages

## Caliper and OpenSCAD Workflow Tips

When measuring an object and entering it into OpenSCAD, say the measurement aloud before typing it to reduce transcription errors. Then read the number back after typing it to confirm.

Recommended sequence:
1. Measure → say "seventy point three millimeters"
2. Type `70.3` in OpenSCAD
3. Read back: "seven zero point three" to confirm

## mdBook Navigation (Web Version of This Curriculum)

If you are reading this curriculum through the web version (mdBook), here are tips for navigating with a screen reader:

### NVDA + Browser

- `H` to jump between headings (chapter navigation)
- `Ctrl + F` to search within the current page
- The sidebar table of contents is a navigation landmark — use `NVDA + F7` to list landmarks, or press `D` to jump between landmark regions
- Previous/Next chapter links are at the bottom of each page

### JAWS + Browser

- `H` to move between headings
- `Ctrl + F` (browser Find) to search
- `JAWS Key + F6` to list headings
- `R` to jump to regions/landmarks
- Use the search box in the mdBook header to search across all chapters

### Keyboard Navigation (No Screen Reader)

- `Left Arrow / Right Arrow` — previous/next chapter
- `S` — focus the search box
- `Escape` — close search results
- `T` — toggle the table of contents sidebar
