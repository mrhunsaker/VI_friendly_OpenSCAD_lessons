# Filament Comparison Table

**Accessibility:** When including images or diagrams, add short alt-text and provide a comment-based walkthrough for any .scad examples so screen-reader users can follow the design steps.


*Quick reference for choosing the right filament. All temperature values are typical ranges — always check the label on your specific spool.*

## When to Use Each Material

### PLA — Use for:
- Prototypes and test prints
- Classroom projects
- Decorative objects
- Tactile models and markers
- Anything that won't be exposed to heat or heavy stress

### PLA — Avoid for:
- Objects left in a hot car or direct sun
- Parts that need to flex or bend without breaking
- High-impact applications

---

### PETG — Use for:
- Functional parts that need to be tougher than PLA
- Parts exposed to mild heat or moisture
- Mechanical components (brackets, clips, mounts)
- Food-contact applications (check your specific brand's food-safe certification)

### PETG — Avoid for:
- Very fine detail (it strings more than PLA)
- Projects where you need the easiest possible print

---

### TPU / Flexible — Use for:
- Wearable objects (wristbands, phone cases)
- Bumpers and shock absorbers
- Grips and handles
- Objects that must deform and return to shape
- Tactile objects that need to feel soft

### TPU — Avoid for:
- Fine detail
- Printing on Bowden extruder setups (the flex causes jams — direct drive only)
- Your first few prints while still learning

---

### ABS — Use for:
- High heat environments
- Parts requiring post-processing (ABS sands and glues easily)
- Professional/industrial contexts with proper ventilation

### ABS — Avoid for:
- Classroom settings without dedicated ventilation
- Beginners
- Any print where warping would be a problem

## Slicer Profile Quick Reference

| Filament | PrusaSlicer Profile Name | Key Changes from PLA Default |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| PLA | Generic PLA | — (baseline) |
| PETG | Generic PETG | Higher temps; slower cooling; use glue stick on PEI |
| TPU | Generic Flex | Lower speed (20–30 mm/s); reduced retraction |
| ABS | Generic ABS | Higher temps; enclosure; disable cooling fan |

---

## Storage Tips

All filament absorbs moisture from the air over time, which causes poor print quality (bubbling, stringing, weak layer bonds).

| Filament | Moisture Sensitivity | Storage Recommendation |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| PLA | Low | Sealed bag with desiccant when not in use |
| PETG | Medium | Sealed bag with desiccant; dry before use if stored open |
| TPU | High | Always store sealed; dry in oven (65°C for 4–6 hrs) if it has absorbed moisture |
| ABS | Medium | Sealed bag with desiccant |

Signs of wet filament: popping or crackling sounds during printing, bubbles in extruded plastic, excessive stringing, weak or brittle prints.
