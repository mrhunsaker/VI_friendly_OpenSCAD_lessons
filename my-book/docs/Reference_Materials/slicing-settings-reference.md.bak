## Recommended Settings by Use Case

| Use Case | Layer Height | Infill | Supports | Notes |
|----------|------------|--------|----------|-------|
| Quick test / prototype | 0.30 mm | 10% | As needed | "Draft" — fastest, roughest |
| Standard project | 0.20 mm | 15–20% | As needed | Best all-around starting point |
| Functional part | 0.20 mm | 30–40% | As needed | Use for parts under stress |
| Fine detail / display | 0.15 mm | 15% | As needed | Smoother surface; slower |
| Solid reference part | 0.20 mm | 40–50% | Rarely | Rarely needed; long print |

## Filament Temperature Settings

| Filament | Nozzle Temp | Bed Temp | Notes |
|---------|------------|---------|-------|
| PLA | 200–215°C | 50–60°C | Easiest to print; default choice |
| PETG | 230–250°C | 70–85°C | Use glue stick on PEI bed |
| TPU | 220–240°C | 30–60°C | Print at 20–30 mm/s max; direct drive only |
| ABS | 230–250°C | 90–110°C | Requires enclosure; more fumes |

*Always check the temperature range on your filament spool — it may vary by brand.*

## Support Settings Guide

| Overhang Angle | Supports Needed? | Recommended Setting |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| < 45° | No | None |
| 45°–60° | Maybe | Preview first; add if sagging |
| > 60° | Yes | Support on build plate only |
| Bridge < 20 mm | No | Bridges usually fine |
| Bridge > 20 mm | Maybe | Preview; consider reorienting |

## Common Print Problems & Quick Fixes

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Print lifts off bed | Poor adhesion / warping | Add brim; use glue stick; level bed |
| Stringing between parts | Temperature too high / retraction | Lower temp 5°C; check retraction settings |
| Layer lines very visible | Layer height too thick | Use 0.15mm or 0.20mm |
| Print takes too long | Layer height too thin / infill too high | Use 0.30mm draft; reduce infill |
| Holes too small | FDM tolerance — always undersized | Add 0.2–0.3mm to hole diameter |
| Part broke at layer boundary | Weak axis perpendicular to layers | Reorient so load is parallel to layers |
| First layer not sticking | Bed not level | Run bed leveling routine |
| Spaghetti / print failure | No supports on overhang | Add supports or reorient |
