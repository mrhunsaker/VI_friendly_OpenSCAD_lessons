# Project 4: Assistive Technology Design

**Unit:** 3 — Open-Ended Projects  
**Duration:** 3–4 weeks  
**Prerequisite:** All of Units 0–2; Lesson 3.1 (Stakeholder Interviews)

---

## Briefing

3D printing has transformative potential in assistive technology — tools that help people with disabilities, injuries, or specific physical needs live and work more independently. Devices that would cost thousands of dollars from a specialty manufacturer can be designed and printed for a few dollars of filament. More importantly, they can be customized to the exact needs of an individual user in ways mass-produced devices cannot.

In this project, you will identify a real person in your community (a classmate, family member, school staff member, or student at your school) who has a specific physical need, and you will design a 3D printed object to address it. You must work directly with that person — they are not just the subject of your design, they are your collaborator.

This project requires **two full prototyping cycles** — you will design, build, test with your user, get feedback, revise, and build again. The first prototype will be imperfect. That is expected and correct.

## Context: Why This Project, Here

This curriculum is developed at the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired (TSBVI). 3D printing and tactile design have particular relevance here: tactile markers, tactile models of objects, braille labels, grip aids, and adaptive tools are areas where custom-designed prints can directly help students and staff. However, the scope of this project is intentionally broad — any physical adaptive need is valid.

---

## Constraints

- Your prototype must incorporate a 3D printed piece designed in OpenSCAD
- You must conduct at least **two structured stakeholder interviews** with your user (one at the start, one after your first prototype)
- You must have **two complete printed prototypes** (two full iterations)
- Your prototype and project are due in **three to four weeks** (your instructor will set the exact date)
- Your final prototype must be signed off by your user/stakeholder

---

## Functional Requirements

Functional requirements for this project are **co-developed with your stakeholder**. You may not write them yourself without stakeholder input. Your requirements must:

- Include at least **5 specific, testable** requirements
- Address both the physical function and the user experience (comfort, ease of use, etc.)
- Include at least one requirement about **durability or repeated use**
- Be documented in your technical documentation and signed or verbally approved by your stakeholder

---

## Design Process

### Week 1: Research & Definition
- Identify your user and their need
- Conduct your **first stakeholder interview** using the techniques from Lesson 3.1
- Research whether similar designs exist (search Printables, Thingiverse, and existing assistive technology databases — see resources below)
- Write your functional requirements
- Sketch at least 3 different design concepts (even rough sketches — the point is to explore options before committing)
- Choose a design direction and begin OpenSCAD modeling

### Week 2: First Prototype
- Complete your OpenSCAD design for Prototype 1
- Slice and print Prototype 1
- Test with your user — observe and document what works and what doesn't
- Conduct your **second stakeholder interview** (focused on feedback about the prototype)
- Revise your design based on feedback

### Week 3: Second Prototype & Documentation
- Implement your revisions in OpenSCAD
- Print Prototype 2
- Test Prototype 2 with your user
- Get stakeholder sign-off
- Complete all documentation

---

## Deliverables

Submit via email and physically turn in your final 3D print:

1. **Technical documentation** (see template below) including:
   - Notes from both stakeholder interviews
   - Functional requirements (stakeholder-approved)
   - Sketch/concept documentation
   - Measurements and design notes
   - Construction and printing notes for both prototypes
   - Comparison of Prototype 1 and Prototype 2
   - Photos of both prototypes (at minimum)
   - Stakeholder sign-off (photo, signature, or written email)
   - Reflections

2. **Final 3D printed prototype** (Prototype 2, or further iteration if done)

3. **OpenSCAD `.scad` file** for your final design

4. **`.stl` file** for your final design

## Existing Assistive Technology Resources (for research)

Before designing from scratch, research whether an existing design can be adapted:

- **Enable Community Foundation / e-NABLE** — 3D printed hand and arm devices  
  [https://enablingthefuture.org/](https://enablingthefuture.org/)

- **Makers Making Change** — assistive technology designs for people with disabilities  
  [https://www.makersmakingchange.com/](https://www.makersmakingchange.com/)

- **NIH 3D Print Exchange — Medical/Assistive Models**  
  [https://3dprint.nih.gov/](https://3dprint.nih.gov/)

- **Printables — search "assistive technology"**  
  [https://www.printables.com/](https://www.printables.com/)

- **Thingiverse — search "adaptive" or "accessibility"**  
  [https://www.thingiverse.com/](https://www.thingiverse.com/)

## Rubric

This project is graded on a 0–9 point scale:

| Category | Points | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Stakeholder process** | 0–3 | Quality of interviews, stakeholder involvement, and co-developed functional requirements |
| **Design & iteration** | 0–3 | Evidence of genuine iteration (Prototype 2 is meaningfully better than Prototype 1); quality of OpenSCAD design |
| **Final prototype** | 0–3 | How well the final print meets the functional requirements; build quality |

**Bonus (up to 1 point):** Exceptional documentation; user testimonial; especially creative or impactful design.
